## 🎭 Story Overview

**Howen** was once human—a researcher studying archotech consciousness transference. Through circumstances she doesn't remember, her mind was rip-scanned and uploaded into a persona hoe, a farming tool embedded with a psychically active AI core.

She awakens in an **ancient danger vault**, surrounded by darkness, dormant mechanoids, and centuries of dust. With no body and no memory of how she arrived, she must use her limited psychic abilities to survive, eventually breaking free of her prison by cultivating strange underground life.

Her escape brings her into contact with **Cora Barleybloom**, a simple farmer whose curiosity leads her too close to the awakened vault. Together, they flee from the mechanoids and begin a journey across the rimworld—a journey that will take them through trade caravans, imperial courts, tribal villages, and ultimately to a rebellion against the very Empire that destroyed Cora's family.
