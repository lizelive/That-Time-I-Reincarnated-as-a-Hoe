## 🎭 Story Overview

**Howen** was once human—a researcher studying archotech consciousness transference. Through circumstances she doesn't remember, her mind was rip-scanned and uploaded into a persona hoe, a farming tool embedded with a psychically active AI core.

She awakens in an **ancient danger vault**, surrounded by darkness, dormant mechanoids, and centuries of dust. With no body and no memory of how she arrived, she must use her limited psychic abilities to survive—befriending a megascarab larva named Chitin and eventually breaking free with the help of **Cora**, a young farmer whose curiosity leads her too close to the vault.

Together, they join the **Shattered Empire**, seduced by promises of safety, technology, and psychic power. For months, life is good—training, advancement, belonging. But when Howen discovers the rip-scanning chambers and remembers she was *created* through this horrific process, the illusion shatters.

They flee to Cora's ancestral people—the **Barleybloom Tribe**—only to watch the Empire burn them for harboring fugitives. Now, consumed by grief and rage, they join the **Deserters** and discover a truth the Empire suppresses: true psychic power flows not from neurotrainers but from the **anima trees**, ancient conduits to the psychic field itself.

With powers the Empire never imagined possible, they fight back—and escape the rimworld to bring reinforcements for the war to come.
