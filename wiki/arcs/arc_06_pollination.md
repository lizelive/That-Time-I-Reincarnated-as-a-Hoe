# Arc 6: Pollination

> *"To spread seeds of change, sometimes you must ally with weeds."*

## Overview

**Chapters**: 41-50  
**Themes**: Resistance, Compromise, Strategy, Consequences  
**Tone**: Military, Tense, Morally Complex

The Pollination Arc sees Cora and Hodan transform from lone deserters into active insurgents. They join the Deserters—a rebel faction of former Imperial soldiers—and participate in a daring operation against the High Stellarch. This arc explores the moral compromises of revolution and the strange alliances that form in war.

## Plot Summary

### Finding the Resistance
Following rumors and contacts, Cora and Hodan locate the Deserters—a loosely organized resistance movement made up of former Imperial soldiers who refused orders. Led by Sergeant Vex, they operate from hidden bases, striking at Imperial targets and disappearing into the wilderness.

### Life Underground
Cora integrates into rebel life. She meets Patch, the cynical medic who patches up wounded fighters; Vex, the pragmatic leader who weighs every life; and dozens of others, each with their own story of Imperial betrayal. Hodan becomes something of a mascot—a persona weapon that fights *against* the Empire feels symbolic.

### First Operations
Cora participates in guerrilla actions: ambushing supply convoys, sabotaging communications, rescuing prisoners. She learns that revolution is messy, brutal, and often involves hurting innocent people caught in the crossfire. Hodan provides tactical advantages through soil-sensing and agricultural knowledge—rebels need to eat, after all.

### The High Stellarch
Intelligence arrives: High Stellarch Mira—one of the highest-ranking Imperial officials—will visit a nearby colony to oversee resource extraction. An attack on such a figure could destabilize the entire Empire.

### The Disguise
Cora and Hodan infiltrate the colony as tribal refugees, one of many displaced peoples seeking shelter. Their tribal background makes this cover convincing. Once inside, they begin growing an impossibly large crop of devilstrand—a valuable fiber plant—to provide cover for their presence.

### Too Much Success
Hodan's farming abilities prove too effective. The devilstrand grows so quickly and so abundantly that it attracts attention. The locals become suspicious of the "refugee" who can produce such miraculous harvests. Cora and Hodan must accelerate their timeline.

### The Tip-Off
Rather than attack the Stellarch directly, Cora tips off a local pirate band about the "poorly defended" colony and its valuable visitor. Let the pirates do the dirty work while the Deserters escape in the chaos.

### Chaos Unleashed
The pirate attack is more successful than anticipated. High Stellarch Mira survives but is humiliated, her guard decimated, the colony devastated. The Empire cannot admit that pirates struck so successfully against such a prominent figure—the political fallout is enormous.

### Seeds of Change
Cora and Hodan escape during the attack, reuniting with the Deserters. They've achieved a major victory without directly bloodying their hands—but people died in that attack, and Cora must live with her role in their deaths.
