The Flowering Arc is the emotional heart of the series. Cora returns home to her village, discovers the true source of psychic powers, and experiences a brief period of peace—before the Empire's retribution arrives. This arc contains the story's darkest moment and sets up Cora's transformation from reluctant deserter to active revolutionary.

## Plot Summary

### Coming Home
Cora and Hodan flee the Empire capital, traveling in disguise back to Cora's village. The journey is tense, with every patrol potentially deadly. But they arrive safely, greeted by Cora's family: her mother Ashara, her brother Finn, and the village elder Grandmother Willow.

### The Anima Tree
Cora, troubled by her artificial psylink, seeks understanding. Grandmother Willow reveals a secret: true psychic power comes from connection with anima trees—ancient organisms that serve as conduits for psychic energy. The Empire's psylinks are crude imitations, stolen technology that comes at terrible cost.

### Natural Connection
Cora meditates beneath the village's anima tree, learning to draw power naturally rather than through the Empire's implant. Hodan participates in the meditation and discovers something unexpected: the anima tree recognizes them as a kindred consciousness, artificial yet alive.

### Days of Peace
For a brief, beautiful time, Cora and Hodan enjoy simple life. Farming, family, the slow rhythm of seasons. Cora teaches her brother about plants; Hodan helps the village achieve unprecedented harvests. It feels like the ending to a happy story.

### The Janissaries
The Empire does not forgive desertion. Commander Theron leads a Janissary squad—elite psychic soldiers—to the village. They demand Cora's surrender and the return of "stolen Imperial property" (Hodan).

### Fire in the Night
When the villagers refuse to betray Cora, the Janissaries attack. The village burns. Grandmother Willow falls protecting the anima tree. Finn is critically wounded. Most devastating of all, Mother Ashara dies shielding Cora from a psychic blast.

### Ashes and Tears
In the aftermath, Cora cradles Hodan and weeps. Everything she loved is gone. The Empire has taken her family, her home, her peace. She has nothing left—except Hodan, Chitter (who survived in the forest), and a burning need for revenge.

### Vengeance Sworn
Standing in the ruins of her village, Cora makes a vow: she will bring down the Empire. Not just escape it, not just survive it—destroy it. Hodan, grieving alongside her, commits to this path. They set out to find others who share their purpose.
