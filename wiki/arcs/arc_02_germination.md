The Germination Arc transforms Hodan from a passive observer into an active participant in the world. This arc introduces Cora, establishes the core relationship of the series, and delivers the first major action sequence as our protagonists escape the awakened Ancient Danger.

## Plot Summary

### Learning to Farm
After accepting their identity, Hodan begins experimenting with their innate abilities. They discover they can sense soil nutrients, encourage plant growth, and even communicate with certain organisms. The underground environment of the Ancient Danger becomes Hodan's first garden—a strange farm of mushrooms, moss, and eventually boom shrooms.

### Unlikely Friendship
Hodan befriends the megascarab that first knocked them over, naming it "Chitter" for the sounds it makes. This friendship teaches Hodan about connection and companionship. Together, they expand the underground farm, with Chitter helping clear debris and Hodan cultivating ever-more-exotic fungi.

### The Intruder
Cora, a young girl from a nearby tribal village, stumbles into the Ancient Danger while foraging. Her intrusion triggers the dormant mechanoid centipede, which activates and opens fire. The crossfire damages the cryopods, awakening confused and terrified ancient humans who are immediately caught in the chaos.

### The Bond
In the mayhem, Cora grabs the nearest weapon she can find—Hodan. The moment of contact creates a persona bond between them. Hodan suddenly experiences Cora's perspective: her racing pulse, her nutrient levels, her overwhelming *hunger*. Hodan's persona traits activate: **Hunger Pangs** (compulsive need to feed the wielder) and **Speed Boost** (enhanced reflexes while farming).

### Escape
Using their combined abilities, Cora and Hodan outsmart the mechanoid. Chitter provides crucial distraction, drawing the centipede's fire while Cora maneuvers through the chaos. They escape the Ancient Danger as it collapses behind them, sealing the mechanoid—and the unfortunate awoken sleepers—inside.
