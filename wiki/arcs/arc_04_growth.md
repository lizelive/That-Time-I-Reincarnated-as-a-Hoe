The Growth Arc represents the series' midpoint and turning point. Cora rises through Imperial ranks, gaining psi powers and status. Meanwhile, Hodan experiences an unexpected development: Cora's growing romantic feelings toward them. But this arc's greatest revelation is a terrible truth about how persona weapons are created—a truth that will shatter their world.

## Plot Summary

### Imperial Welcome
Cora and Hodan arrive at the Empire capital with Aldric's sponsorship. The city is overwhelming—gleaming towers, psychic nobility, and technology beyond anything Cora has seen. They undergo evaluation, with Hodan attracting particular interest as an "unregistered" persona weapon.

### Climbing the Ranks
Through a combination of farming skills (enhanced by Hodan), Aldric's connections, and genuine competence, Cora rises rapidly through Imperial ranks. She begins as a commoner, becomes a Yeoman, and eventually earns the title of Dame—minor nobility.

### The Psylink
As a reward for service, Cora receives a psylink implant—technology that grants psychic abilities. She can now project force, manipulate minds, and sense emotions. Hodan notices that the psi powers feel different from the natural connection they share—more artificial, more *wrong*.

### Falling in Love
Working together, fighting together, growing together—Cora's feelings for Hodan deepen beyond partnership into something like love. Hodan, uncertain how to process such feelings as a non-human consciousness, finds themselves reciprocating in their own way. Their bond strengthens, but Hodan wonders: can a hoe truly love?

### Whispers of Truth
Hodan begins hearing disturbing rumors about persona weapons. Where do they come from? Why are they so rare? Why does the Empire guard their production so carefully? Aldric, troubled by Cora's questions, warns her to stop asking.

### The Soul Forge
Cora and Hodan infiltrate the Soul Forge—the Empire's secret facility for creating persona weapons. What they discover is horrifying: persona weapons are made by forcibly transferring human consciousness into weapons. The "volunteers" are criminals, dissidents, and captured enemies. Hodan realizes their own origin: they were once human, their memories stripped away in the forging process.

### Broken Trust
The revelation shatters Cora's faith in the Empire. Her psi powers, her rank, her success—all built on a foundation of atrocity. Hodan, processing the trauma of their origin, supports Cora through the crisis.

### The Decision
Cora and Hodan choose to leave the Empire. But desertion is treason, punishable by death—or worse, the Soul Forge. They must plan carefully, or become the very thing they despise.
