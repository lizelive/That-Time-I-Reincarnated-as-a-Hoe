The Seedling Arc sees Cora and Hodan establish themselves as psychite farmers and tea merchants. This arc introduces key supporting characters, including Count Aldric Voss, and ends with the pivotal decision to join the Empire—a choice that will define the next phase of their journey.

## Plot Summary

### New Beginnings
Cora returns to her village with Hodan and Chitter. The villagers are wary of the persona weapon but accept Cora back. With Hodan's abilities, Cora begins cultivating a field of psychite—a valuable but controversial crop used to make recreational drugs and medicines.

### The Giant Fields
Hodan's farming powers prove remarkably effective. The psychite plants grow to unusual size and potency. Soon, Cora has the largest psychite farm in the region—attracting both legitimate buyers and dangerous attention.

### The Mad Hare
While tending the fields, Cora encounters Count Aldric Voss—a minor Imperial noble—being attacked by a berserk hare (a creature mutated by eating psychite leaves). The ensuing fight becomes legendary: the "Battle of Carrot Time," where Hodan and Cora defeat the mad hare in a surprisingly difficult combat, saving the Count's life.

### The Tea Business
Grateful for the rescue, Aldric helps Cora establish a legitimate tea business. Psychite tea is technically legal (unlike flake or yayo) and commands high prices. Cora becomes a successful merchant, trading with various factions passing through the region.

### Raiders
Success attracts predators. A naked man armed only with a knife—later nicknamed "Crackpot"—infiltrates Cora's storehouse. In his drug-addled rage, he sets fire to the tea stores and dies in the blaze. But Crackpot was not alone: ten heavily armed raiders arrive days later, demanding revenge for their fallen companion.

### Imperial Salvation
The raiders are too many to fight. Just as defeat seems certain, an Empire trade caravan arrives and intervenes—not to save Cora, but to protect their trading interests. The raiders are driven off, but the Empire merchants refuse to deal with Cora directly: her rank is too low.

### The Decision
Humiliated by her low status and recognizing the limits of independent farming, Cora decides to pursue Imperial citizenship. Aldric offers to sponsor her. Hodan has reservations, but supports Cora's choice. They prepare to leave for the Empire capital.
