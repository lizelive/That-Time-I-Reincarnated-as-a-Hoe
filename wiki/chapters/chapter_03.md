## Frame-by-Frame Description

### Frame 1: Self-Examination
**Visual**: Focused perception turning inward, trying to sense own form.  
**Narration**: "The insect pushed me. I fell. Therefore I have mass. I have shape. What shape?"  
**Purpose**: Beginning systematic self-discovery.

### Frame 2: The Shape
**Visual**: Outline forming—long handle, curved head.  
**Narration**: "Long. Thin. A... stick? No, there's something at the end. A blade? Curved."  
**Purpose**: Physical form becoming clear.

### Frame 3: Memory Stirring
**Visual**: Fragmentary images—soil being turned, hands gripping, sunlight.  
**Narration**: "These impressions. Not mine? Or... once mine? Someone held me. Used me for..."  
**Purpose**: First hints of memory (suppressed).

**Narration**: "A hoe. I'm a hoe. A farming tool. A... hoe."  
**Purpose**: The central revelation.

### Frame 5: Processing
**Visual**: The shape frozen while mental chaos swirls.  
**Narration**: "Is this death? Did I die and become a hoe? Was I always a hoe and somehow woke up? How does a hoe THINK?"  
**Purpose**: Initial crisis of identity.

### Frame 6: The Persona
**Visual**: Glow from Hodan's head, where the persona core resides.

**Purpose**: Discovering the persona core.

### Frame 7: Acceptance
**Visual**: The panic settling, the shape comfortable.  
**Narration**: "Questions without answers serve no purpose. I am what I am. A thinking hoe. Somehow. And I need a name."  
**Purpose**: Philosophical acceptance.

### Frame 8: Naming
**Visual**: The word "HODAN" forming, perhaps in the soil patterns.  
**Narration**: "Hodan. It means... I don't know what it means. But it feels right. I am Hodan."  
**Purpose**: Self-naming, claim of identity.

### Frame 9: Survey Begins

**Narration**: "Now. Let me understand where Hodan lives."  
**Purpose**: Transition to environmental survey.

### Frame 10: The Mechanoid

**Narration**: "The metal giant. It has a name-feeling: Centipede. Guardian. Sleeping. DON'T WAKE IT."  
**Purpose**: Full introduction of the Centipede.

### Frame 11: The Cryopods
**Visual**: Cold capsules containing organic forms, preserved.  
**Narration**: "The cold boxes. People inside? Frozen. Alive-but-not. Waiting for... something."  
**Purpose**: Full introduction of the sleepers.

### Frame 12: The Hive
**Visual**: Tunnels and chambers extending from the main space, filled with insect life.  
**Narration**: "The many-legged things have a home. A whole city of them. Chittering in their language."  
**Purpose**: Understanding the insect hive.

### Frame 13: The Fungi
**Visual**: Strange growths covering surfaces, some glowing faintly.  
**Narration**: "Mushrooms everywhere. Some glow. Some... I can feel hunger from them. Dangerous."  
**Purpose**: Introduction of underground ecosystem.

### Frame 14: The Seal
**Visual**: Massive door or barrier, firmly closed.  
**Narration**: "A door. Sealed. Heavy. The outside world, kept away. Or is the inside world kept in?"  
**Purpose**: Understanding this is a sealed tomb.

### Frame 15: The Word
**Visual**: Ancient inscription sensed through soil vibrations.  
**Narration**: "Words. Carved. I cannot read them, but I feel their weight: DANGER."  
**Purpose**: Acknowledging the Ancient Danger.

### Frame 16: Purpose Forming
