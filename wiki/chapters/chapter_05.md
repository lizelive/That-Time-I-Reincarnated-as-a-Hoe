## Frame-by-Frame Description

### Frame 1: Curiosity
**Visual**: Hodan's garden thriving, but attention turning toward the massive presence.  
**Narration**: "My garden grows. But the metal giant haunts my awareness. What is it?"  
**Purpose**: Motivating exploration.

### Frame 2: Approach
**Visual**: Perception carefully extending toward the mechanoid.  
**Narration**: "Carefully. Slowly. The soil around it is... different. Compressed by weight. Scarred by heat."  
**Purpose**: Beginning investigation.

### Frame 3: Scale
**Visual**: Size comparison—Hodan tiny against the massive machine.  
**Narration**: "It's enormous. Fifteen meters? Twenty? I can't sense it directly—only its absence in the soil."  
**Purpose**: Establishing threat level.

### Frame 4: The Form
**Visual**: Segmented body shape emerging from soil impressions.  
**Narration**: "Segments. Many of them. Like the many-legged things, but metal. And so much bigger."  
**Purpose**: Describing the centipede form.

### Frame 5: The Weapons
**Visual**: Heat-scarred areas around the centipede's front section.  
**Narration**: "The front section. Heat damage radiating outward. It has weapons. Fire weapons."  
**Purpose**: Establishing armament.

### Frame 6: Dormancy
**Visual**: The centipede still, no vibrations, minimal energy signature.  
**Narration**: "But it sleeps. No vibrations. No energy flow. Dead? No—waiting. Like the cold people."  
**Purpose**: Understanding its state.

### Frame 7: Trigger
**Visual**: Subtle sensors on the centipede, aimed at the entrance.  
**Narration**: "Sensors. Aimed at the seal. If the door opens... if something enters..."  
**Purpose**: Foreshadowing the activation trigger.

### Frame 8: Guardian Purpose
**Visual**: The centipede positioned between the entrance and the cryopods.  
**Narration**: "It guards. The cold people, the strange equipment, maybe even me. From outside threats."  
**Purpose**: Understanding its role.

### Frame 9: The Question
**Visual**: Hodan's perception pulling back to consider the whole.  
**Narration**: "But what happens when the threat is already inside? What happens when it wakes and I'm HERE?"  
**Purpose**: Raising stakes.

### Frame 10: Distance
**Visual**: Maximum distance established between Hodan and the centipede.  
**Narration**: "I retreat. As far as I can get. The garden is important. Being alive is more important."  
**Purpose**: Showing survival instinct.

### Frame 11: The Cold People
**Visual**: Cryopods in focus—bodies visible through frost.  
**Narration**: "The frozen ones. Are they what the guardian protects? Or are they just more inventory?"  
**Purpose**: Connecting elements.

### Frame 12: Faces
**Visual**: Impressions of faces through the frost—human, diverse.  
**Narration**: "Faces. Different faces. Different ages. They were people once. Maybe they'll be people again."  
**Purpose**: Humanizing the sleepers.

### Frame 13: Waiting
**Visual**: Wide shot of the entire chamber—centipede, cryopods, Hodan's garden, insects.  
**Narration**: "We all wait. The guardian. The sleepers. The insects. Me. Waiting for something to change."  
**Purpose**: Establishing status quo.

### Frame 14: Foreshadowing
**Visual**: The sealed entrance, suggesting what lies beyond.  
**Narration**: "The seal can't hold forever. Someday, something will come through. And when it does..."  
**Purpose**: Building anticipation.

### Frame 15: Resolution
**Visual**: Hodan returning attention to their garden.  
**Narration**: "Until then, I garden. It's what I was made for. Whatever comes, I'll face it well-tended."  
**Purpose**: Chapter conclusion, maintaining character voice.
