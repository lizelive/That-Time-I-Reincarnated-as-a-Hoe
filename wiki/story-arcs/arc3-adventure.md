# Arc 3: Adventure on the Rim

> *"The vault was a prison. The rim is a test. Every day brings new challenges—weather, wildlife, raiders, politics. I thought I knew fear. I was wrong."*

Chitin surprisingly returns, having survived the vault collapse.

## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1: The Outside World
*"I spent so long wanting out. Now I'm out, and the world is trying to kill us."*

**POV**: Howen and Cora (alternating)

Cora and Howen are alone, exhausted, and lost. The hillside farm is destroyed (collateral damage from the vault awakening). They have nothing but each other and the clothes Cora wears. They must find shelter, food, and answers.

**Key Moments**:
- Surveying the damage around the vault
- Cora's grief for Old Tam (killed by a stray mechanoid)
- Finding shelter in a ruined farmhouse
- Their first real conversation (Howen explains what she is)

**Chapter Hook**: Smoke on the horizon—a settlement, or a burning.

---

### Chapter 2: Learning to Trade
*"We have nothing to trade. Except me. It turns out persona weapons are valuable."*

**POV**: Cora

They reach Trader's Rest, a neutral trading post. Howen suggests they approach carefully—persona weapons attract attention. When Cora reluctantly reveals what she carries, they get their first taste of the power and danger Howen represents.

**Key Moments**:
- Arrival at Trader's Rest
- First encounter with the merchant class
- Meeting Trader Jax Hollow
- Learning that persona weapons are incredibly rare and valuable

**Chapter Hook**: Jax offers a deal: travel with his caravan, use Howen's presence to deter bandits, get paid in supplies and training.

---

### Chapter 3: The Caravan Life
*"Walking for hours, camping rough, watching the horizon for threats. It's exhausting. It's also the most alive I've felt since... ever, I think."*

**POV**: Cora (adapting to travel)

Cora joins Jax's caravan as a guard-by-association (Howen's deterrent effect does the heavy lifting). She learns the rhythm of road life: walking, resting, trading, moving on. It's grueling but educational.

**Key Moments**:
- Daily routine of caravan travel
- Cora learning practical skills (navigation, first aid, bartering)
- Howen studying the political landscape through overheard conversations
- First glimpse of Imperial soldiers at a checkpoint

**Chapter Hook**: The caravan master warns them: raider territory ahead.

---

### Chapter 4: Jax's Advice
*"'Don't trust anyone completely,' he said. 'Not even me. Especially not me.' I think I like him."*

**POV**: Howen (observing, analyzing)

Trader Jax takes an interest in Cora—or rather, in the weapon she carries. He provides invaluable advice about surviving on the rim: who to trust, what to avoid, how the factions operate. His cynicism masks genuine concern.

**Key Moments**:
- Jax explaining the political landscape
- Information about the Empire (powerful, expanding, dangerous)
- Information about tribals (scattered, proud, targeted)
- Jax's personal history (hints at past Imperial service)
- His warning: "The Empire wants your hoe. Be careful."

**Chapter Hook**: Howen senses something following them. Something familiar.

---

### Chapter 5: First Blood
*"I've killed weeds. I've killed bugs. This was different. These were people trying to kill us."*

**POV**: Cora (combat perspective)

Raiders attack the caravan. Cora fights for the first time, wielding Howen against human opponents. Howen's combat traits activate fully—the kill-focus, the enhanced speed. They survive, but Cora is shaken by the violence.

**Key Moments**:
- Raider ambush
- Cora's first human combat
- Howen's disturbing satisfaction at ending threats
- Aftermath: Cora's shock, Howen's concern
- Caravan casualties and grief

**Chapter Hook**: A familiar shape in the darkness post-battle. Chitin has found them.

---

### Chapter 6: Between the Powers
*"Chitin is back. Bigger. Fiercer. But still mine—if anything can be said to own a megascarab."*

**POV**: Howen (reunion)

Chitin's return is joyful but complicated. The megascarab has grown significantly and can no longer travel inconspicuously. But it has clearly been following them since the vault. Howen and Chitin's bond remains strong; Cora is deeply unsettled.

**Key Moments**:
- Chitin's emergence from the wilderness
- Reunion with Howen
- Cora's fear/distrust of the giant beetle
- Deciding what to do (Chitin can't travel with the caravan)
- Chitin agrees to follow at a distance

**Chapter Hook**: The caravan reaches Imperial territory. A choice approaches.

---

### Chapter 7: The Choice
*"The Empire offers safety, training, resources. They also, apparently, offer slavery. How do we weigh that?"*

**POV**: Cora and Howen (debate)

Imperial recruiters offer Cora a position in the auxiliary forces. The benefits are substantial: regular meals, training, protection, eventual citizenship. But Howen has heard whispers about what the Empire really does. They argue about the right path.

**Key Moments**:
- Imperial recruitment pitch
- Howen's warnings about slavery and brutality
- Cora's counterargument: they need resources and skills
- Jax's neutral advice: "Use them before they use you"
- The decision: they'll join, but stay alert for escape opportunities

**Chapter Hook**: The recruiter's eyes linger on Howen. "That's a fine tool you have. The Empire appreciates fine tools."

---

### Chapter 8: Imperial Hospitality
*"The barracks are clean. The food is regular. The discipline is absolute. And everywhere, I see chains."*

**POV**: Cora (entering the Empire)

Cora and Howen arrive at Fort Vigilance, the regional Imperial garrison. The initial experience is positive—structure, resources, competent training. But small details unsettle them: slaves serving meals, harsh punishments for minor infractions, the way officers speak about "outlanders."

**Key Moments**:
- Arrival at Fort Vigilance
- Introduction to military life
- Meeting Lord-Executor Malachai (briefly, formally)
- First glimpse of slave quarters
- Cora's growing unease masked by the need for skills

**Chapter Hook**: Training begins. Cora will learn to fight. But what will she become?

---

### Chapter 9: Proving Grounds
*"I'm getting stronger. Faster. More dangerous. Is that what I want? Does it matter?"*

**POV**: Cora (training montage)

A training arc chapter. Cora learns Imperial combat techniques, tactics, and discipline. She excels—her natural talent combined with Howen's enhancements makes her exceptional. Officers take notice. Promotions seem likely.

**Key Moments**:
- Training sequences (ranged, melee, formation)
- Cora bonding with fellow recruits
- Recognition from superior officers
- Howen's private concerns about Cora's enthusiasm
- A fellow recruit whispers about "the slave pits"

**Chapter Hook**: Cora is offered an opportunity: participate in a "pacification mission" for accelerated advancement.

---

### Chapter 10: Questions Without Answers
*"What is a pacification mission? The officers smile when they say it. That smile is wrong."*

**POV**: Howen (investigation)

While Cora prepares for the mission, Howen uses her limited mobility and psychic senses to investigate. She learns disturbing truths: pacification means attacking independent settlements that refuse tribute. Villages like... Barleyhollow.

**Key Moments**:
- Howen eavesdropping through psychic awareness
- Discovering the true nature of Imperial expansion
- The weight of the decision they've made
- Howen trying to warn Cora without revealing how she knows

**Chapter Hook**: The mission targets a tribal village. Cora must participate—or reveal their true loyalties.

---

### Chapter 11: Rising Through Ranks
*"We participated. We didn't kill anyone who wasn't fighting. But we helped. We were there. That makes us complicit."*

**POV**: Cora (moral crisis)

The pacification mission occurs. Cora walks a difficult line—participating enough to maintain cover, but pulling strikes, warning where she can. She succeeds in avoiding direct atrocity, but the village is taken, its people enslaved. The guilt is immense.

**Key Moments**:
- The mission itself (brief, brutal)
- Cora's attempts to minimize harm
- Seeing slavery up close
- Cora's promotion for "efficiency"
- Private breakdown with Howen afterward

**Chapter Hook**: Cora asks the question she's been avoiding: "What happened to Barleyhollow? My home. What did the Empire do?"

---

### Chapter 12: The Price of Stability
*"We have food. We have shelter. We have rank. And we have blood on our hands. Is this the price of survival?"*

**POV**: Howen and Cora (reflection)

A quiet chapter to close the arc. Cora and Howen take stock of where they are: trained, resourced, positioned. But at what cost? They commit to finding the truth about Barleyhollow and planning their escape. The Empire is a means, not an end.

**Key Moments**:
- Honest conversation about their situation
- Cora reveals her full backstory (Barleyhollow, her family)
- Howen reveals more of her past (Vance, the research)
- They agree: find answers, then get out
- Chitin is still following, waiting

**Chapter Hook**: Cora begins researching Imperial archives. The truth about Barleyhollow—and who ordered its destruction—waits to be found.
