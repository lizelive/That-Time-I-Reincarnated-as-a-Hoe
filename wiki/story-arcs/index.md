# Story Arcs

> *"Every journey starts with a single step. Mine started with being dropped in a vault as a farming tool. Not ideal, but you work with what you've got."*

**The Time I Reincarnated as a Hoe** is told across five major story arcs, each containing 12 chapters. The narrative follows Howen from her awakening in an ancient vault to her eventual escape from Persephone-7.

Howen develops her powers, learning to manipulate the growth around her. She befriends an unlikely ally in Chitin the megascarab larva, battles against weeds and insects, cultivates mushrooms for sustenance and ultimately escape.

Free from the vault, Cora and Howen must survive in a world neither fully understands. They join trading caravans, learn the political landscape, face raiders and difficult choices. When an opportunity arises to join the Shattered Empire's auxiliary forces, they see a path to stability—unaware of the darkness that awaits.

Within the Empire, Cora advances through the ranks while Howen observes the system's cruelty. The discovery that the Empire destroyed Cora's family—and that Dr. Vance, the woman who rip-scanned Howen, works for them—shatters any hope of accommodation. When they flee, the High Janissary Krell is sent to hunt them.

**Setting**: Imperial Garrison, Slave Markets, Barleyhollow Ruins

### [Arc 5: The Deserter's Path](./arc5-deserter.md)
*Chapters 1-12*

Fleeing the Empire, our protagonists find sanctuary with the Thornwood Tribe—sanctuary that costs the village everything when Imperial forces burn it in retribution. Joining the Deserters, they work toward a seemingly impossible goal: escape from the rimworld entirely. When Charles Wheatstone makes contact, a desperate plan takes shape. The final confrontation with Krell determines whether hope survives.

**Themes**: Sacrifice, Resistance, Hope
