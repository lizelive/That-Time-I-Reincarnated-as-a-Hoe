## Background

### House Voss History
House Voss is a minor noble house, elevated several generations ago for military service. They hold the Verdant March—a fertile region known for agricultural output. The house's wealth comes from trade and farming rather than conquest.

### Aldric's Youth
Aldric was trained for both war and administration, as befitting a noble heir. He served in the Imperial military briefly, earning his battle wound and a distaste for direct combat. Upon inheriting his title, he focused on economic development rather than military glory.

### The Rabbit Incident
While traveling through the outer territories, Aldric was attacked by a psychite-maddened hare. The creature's vicious assault would have been fatal (or at least deeply embarrassing) had Cora and Hodan not intervened. Being saved by a tribal girl with a farming tool created an unexpected debt of honor.

### Sponsorship
Grateful and recognizing Cora's potential, Aldric sponsored her Imperial citizenship. His motives were mixed:
- Genuine gratitude for the rescue
- Economic interest in her farming abilities
- Desire to have a competent ally
- Curiosity about her persona weapon

### Post-Desertion
When Cora fled the Empire, Aldric was questioned but not implicated. He claimed ignorance of her plans, which was technically true. His feelings about her actions are complex—he understands why she left but mourns the loss of a promising ally.

## Relationships

### Cora (Debtor/Ally)
- **Bond Type**: Life debt, evolved to complicated friendship
- **Dynamic**: Aldric genuinely wanted to help Cora while also benefiting from her abilities
- **Key Moments**: 
  - The Rabbit rescue
  - Sponsoring citizenship
  - Helping establish tea business
- **Post-Desertion**: Aldric privately hopes Cora succeeded in whatever she's doing
- **Quote**: "I owed her my life. I gave her opportunity. The fact that she used it to challenge everything I believed... well, the debt is paid either way."

### Hodan (Curiosity/Unease)
- **Bond Type**: Fascination mixed with discomfort
- **Dynamic**: Aldric recognizes Hodan as remarkable but finds persona weapons unsettling
- **Awareness**: Does not know the full truth about persona weapon creation
- **Quote**: "The hoe speaks. The hoe thinks. The hoe loves. What does that make the rest of us?"

### The Empire (Loyalty/Doubt)
- **Bond Type**: Citizen/subject relationship
- **Dynamic**: Publicly loyal, privately questioning
- **Tension**: Witnessing Cora's rise and fall planted seeds of doubt
- **Quote**: "The Empire provides order. The Empire provides justice. The Empire provides... other things I prefer not to examine too closely."

### House Voss (Family Duty)
- **Bond Type**: Head of house
- **Dynamic**: Responsible for family legacy and survival
- **Constraint**: Family obligations limit his ability to act on personal beliefs
- **Quote**: "I am not only myself. I am House Voss. What I do affects generations."

## Character Arc

## Motives

### Primary Motive: Honor
Aldric was raised to value honor above all. Repaying debts, keeping promises, and maintaining reputation drive his actions.

### Secondary Motive: Self-Interest
Aldric also recognizes the practical benefits of his choices. Helping Cora was honorable *and* profitable.

### Hidden Motive: Legacy
Aldric wants House Voss to survive and prosper. This sometimes conflicts with personal ethics—he chooses family security over moral stands.

### Unresolved Motive: Reform
Deep down, Aldric wishes he could change things without risking everything. Cora's revolutionary path is what he lacks the courage to attempt.

## Quotes

> "You saved me from a rabbit. A *rabbit*. My reputation may never recover... but my life was worth the embarrassment."

> "The Empire tells us persona weapons are tools. Then why does this one argue with its wielder about crop rotation? Tools do not have opinions about fertilizer."

> "I gave Cora what I could—access, opportunity, a chance. What she built with it exceeded anything I imagined. What she destroyed with it... well, some things needed destroying."
