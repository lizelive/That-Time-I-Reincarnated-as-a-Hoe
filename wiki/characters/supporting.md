- Larval stage: Dog-sized, pale white carapace, large mandibles, six stumpy legs
- Adult stage: Horse-sized, iridescent black-green carapace, massive mandibles capable of crushing plasteel
- Distinctive marking: A crack in the carapace from a mechanoid attack, giving it a "lightning bolt" pattern

- Fiercely protective of those it considers part of its "hive"
- Surprisingly playful for a giant beetle

- Arc 5: Fully grown; becomes a formidable ally in combat

**Key Relationship**: Howen is Chitin's "hive-mother"—the insect imprinted on her psychic presence.

> *"I don't know what a megascarab considers love, but I think Chitin feels it. And honestly? I feel it back."* — Howen
