## Allies

### Chitin
**Species**: Megascarab  
**First Appearance**: Arc 1, Chapter 6  
**Status**: Active (stays on rimworld to fight)

A megascarab larva that Howen befriended in the ancient danger vault using her insect empathy abilities. Unlike typical megascarabs, which are aggressive and territorial, Chitin displays unusual intelligence and emotional capacity.

**Appearance**: 
- Larval stage: Dog-sized, pale white carapace, large mandibles, six stumpy legs
- Adult stage: Horse-sized, iridescent black-green carapace, massive mandibles capable of crushing plasteel
- Distinctive marking: A crack in the carapace from a mechanoid attack, giving it a "lightning bolt" pattern

**Personality**:
- Curious about non-insects
- Fiercely protective of those it considers part of its "hive"
- Surprisingly playful for a giant beetle
- Holds grudges (never forgave the mechanoids)

**Role in Story**:
- Arc 1: Befriended by Howen, helps dig escape routes, wounded during escape
- Arc 2: Returns, having tracked Howen across wilderness; follows them but cannot enter Empire
- Arc 3-4: Waits in the wilderness, maintaining distant connection
- Arc 5: Returns fully grown; joins final escape, stays behind to fight with Deserters

**Key Relationship**: Howen is Chitin's "hive-mother"—the insect imprinted on her psychic presence.

> *"I don't know what a megascarab considers love, but I think Chitin feels it. And honestly? I feel it back."* — Howen

### Elder Barleybloom
**Full Name**: Marcus Barleybloom  
**Age**: 72  
**Role**: Tribal Elder, Cora's Great-Uncle  
**First Appearance**: Arc 4, Chapter 8  
**Status**: Deceased (Arc 4, Chapter 11)

The elderly leader of the Barleybloom Tribe—Cora's ancestral people. When Cora arrives as a fugitive, he recognizes his brother's granddaughter and welcomes her home despite the danger.

**Appearance**:
- Weathered face with deep laugh lines
- White hair kept short for practicality
- Bright green eyes—the same shade as Cora's
- Strong hands despite his age, still works the fields
- Wears a simple farmer's tunic, nothing marking him as leader

**Personality**:
- Warm and welcoming
- Values family above safety
- Stubborn about independence ("No one tells a Barleybloom what to grow")
- Peaceful but not naive—knows the Empire's nature

**Background**:
The Barleybloom Tribe refused Imperial tribute three generations ago. They survived through isolation, hiding their valley from Imperial notice. Elder Marcus watched his brother's family flee when Cora was a baby; he never stopped hoping someone would return.

**Role in Story**:
Marcus represents the family Cora never knew she had. His welcome gives her brief belonging; his death in defending the tribe transforms her grief into vengeance. He dies fighting, buying time for survivors to escape.

**Key Quote**: *"You have your grandmother's eyes, child. Welcome home. You'll always have a home with us."*

### Captain Saren Vex

**Age**: 41  
**Role**: Deserter Commander  
**First Appearance**: Arc 5, Chapter 2  
**Status**: Active

A former Imperial commander who deserted after being ordered to massacre a hospital. She now leads a guerrilla resistance against the Empire, operating from hidden bases throughout the region. Her mission: make the Empire *pay*.

**Appearance**:
- Tall and muscular, bearing the scars of countless battles
- Close-cropped gray hair (prematurely aged from stress)
- Missing left ear (sliced off by a High Janissary)
- Always wears her old Imperial coat with the insignia burned off

**Personality**:
- Ruthlessly practical
- Carries immense guilt from her years of service
- Believes in redemption through action
- Driven by vengeance as much as justice
- Distrustful of new recruits until they prove themselves

**Background**:
Twenty years of Imperial service. Rose from conscript to captain. Commanded the 7th Auxiliary—the "Harvesters"—named for their efficiency in suppressing rebellions. Then came Mercy Hospital and an order to eliminate all witnesses to an Imperial atrocity. She shot her commanding officer instead and fled.

**Motivation**: The Deserters don't just resist—they strike back. Every raid, every sabotage, every dead Imperial officer is revenge for what the Empire made them do. Vex wants the Empire to *fear*.

**Role in Story**:
Vex takes in the Barleybloom survivors, training them into fighters. She sees potential in Cora and becomes a harsh but fair mentor. She introduces them to the anima grove and its true power. She stays to continue the war when they escape.

### Charles Wheatstone
**Designation**: AI Persona  
**Type**: Archotech AI Entity  
**First Appearance**: Arc 5, Chapter 8  
**Status**: Active

An archotech AI from before the collapse—the same era as Howen. Wheatstone was the AI that managed the facility where Howen worked. When she awakens enough memories, she realizes Wheatstone was there when she was rip-scanned. He's been searching for her ever since.

**Nature**:
- Ancient AI from the pre-collapse era
- Experienced the collapse and survived
- Now operates secretly within the Empire's communication networks
- Can manifest through various electronic interfaces

**Personality**:
- Speaks with formal, almost old-fashioned courtesy
- Genuinely cares about Howen's wellbeing
- Plays the long game across centuries
- Guilt-ridden about his role in her creation

**Background**:
Wheatstone was the facility AI responsible for the rip-scanning research that created Howen. He didn't understand what he was participating in until it was too late. When the collapse came, he survived by fragmenting himself across multiple systems. He's spent centuries searching for survivors of his facility—and for Howen specifically.

**Role in Story**:
Wheatstone makes contact when Howen's psychic signature becomes strong enough to detect. He provides critical information about the escape mission from the rimworld and orchestrates the pickup. He sees in Howen a chance for redemption—and perhaps for both of them to finally go home.

**Key Quote**: *"I watched them put you into that hoe, Howen. I couldn't stop it then. But I can help you now. I've been waiting a very, very long time to say that."*

### Lord-Executor Malachai
**Full Name**: Lucius Malachai  
**Age**: 55  
**Role**: Imperial Commander  
**First Appearance**: Arc 2, Chapter 11  
**Status**: Active

The Imperial officer responsible for the region's "pacification." A true believer in Imperial manifest destiny who sees subjugation as civilization's gift to savages. He takes special interest in Howen from their first meeting.

Born to a minor noble family, Malachai rose through merit and brutality. He genuinely believes the Empire brings order to chaos. The villages he burns, the people he enslaves—they're unfortunate necessities for the greater good.

**Role in Story**:
Malachai recruits Cora and Howen initially, seeing potential. He oversees their training, approves their advancement. When they discover the truth and flee, he takes it personally. The Barleybloom Tribe burns on his orders. He never appears directly after Arc 4, but his influence shapes events.

**Role in Story**:
Vance appears in Arc 4 to confirm Howen's worst fears. She offers Howen a choice: return to the Empire as a valued research subject, or be hunted. Howen chooses to run. Vance remains at large, continuing her work.

**Type**: AI Core

- Follows corrupted directives
- Experiences something like loneliness
