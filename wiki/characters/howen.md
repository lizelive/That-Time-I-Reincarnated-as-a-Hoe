## Physical Description

### As a Human (Memories)
Howen remembers herself as a woman of medium height with dark hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. She wore researcher's attire—practical jumpsuits with too many pockets. Her eyes were a deep brown, described by colleagues as "uncomfortably observant."

### As a Persona Hoe
The hoe that houses Howen's consciousness is a masterwork tool of clearly ancient design:

- **Length**: Approximately 1.4 meters
- **Head**: Curved blade of dark metal with subtle archotech circuitry patterns
- **Handle**: Hardwood reinforced with plasteel, warm to the touch when Howen is active
- **Core**: A small psychically-active AI core embedded where the handle meets the head, glowing faintly blue when she communicates

The tool shows no signs of age despite centuries in the vault. Small roots and fungal growths sometimes appear along the handle when Howen is particularly emotional or using her powers.

## Traits & Abilities

### Manifest Traits (Known to Others)

**Hunger Pangs**  
Howen's wielder experiences an almost supernatural appetite. This drives them to eat more but also to grow food—a compulsion that works in Howen's favor.

**Fast Mover**  
When wielded, Howen enhances her user's speed and reflexes, particularly for agricultural tasks. In combat, this translates to swift, precise strikes.

### Hidden Traits (Revealed Over Time)

**Kill-Focused**  
Buried deep in Howen's psyche is an edge of violence. While she was a researcher, something in the rip-scan process or her experiences in the vault has given her an affinity for ending threats permanently. She feels a disturbing satisfaction when eliminating enemies.

**Psychic Hypersensitizer**  
Howen can sense psychic phenomena with extreme sensitivity. This allows her to detect approaching threats, communicate through psychic impressions, and eventually develop more complex abilities.

### Developed Abilities (By Arc)

| Arc | Ability | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Psychic Whisper** | Basic communication through emotional impressions |
| 2 | **Growth Acceleration** | Speed up plant growth in her immediate vicinity |
| 2 | **Fungal Communion** | Communicate with and direct fungal networks |
| 2 | **Insect Empathy** | Basic emotional connection with insects |
| 3 | **Harvest Frenzy** | Temporarily boost wielder's combat abilities |

## Personality

### Core Traits

- **Curious**: Even as a tool, Howen never stops questioning and learning
- **Pragmatic**: She makes difficult decisions with clear-eyed realism
- **Protective**: Those she bonds with receive her fierce loyalty
- **Self-Deprecating**: Uses humor to cope with her bizarre existence
- **Haunted**: Carries guilt about her past and the violence she's capable of

### Internal Conflicts

1. **Identity Crisis**: Is she still Howen Ashford, or has she become something else entirely?
2. **The Violence Within**: Her kill-focused nature disturbs her; she was never violent as a human
3. **Memory Gaps**: Crucial memories of her rip-scan are missing—deliberately?
4. **Human Connection**: She craves touch, taste, warmth—sensations she can never have again

### Communication Style

Since she cannot speak aloud, Howen communicates through:
- Psychic impressions (emotions, images, sensations)
- Subtle movements (tugging, warming/cooling, vibrating)
- Growing patterns (arranging plants to spell words)
- Direct mind-connection (rare, exhausting, used in emergencies)

## Backstory

### The Researcher
Dr. Howen Ashford worked for the **Ascendancy Institute**, a research organization studying archotech consciousness transference. Her specialty was the interface between organic minds and machine substrates—specifically, how to preserve identity during the transfer process.

### The Betrayal
Her final clear memories are of a breakthrough—discovering that existing rip-scan technology wasn't just copying minds but *fragmenting* them, leaving the original damaged. Before she could report her findings, she was betrayed.

### The Gap
She has no memory of her own rip-scan or how she ended up in a persona hoe specifically. These missing memories drive much of her personal quest.

### The Vault
She awoke in darkness, confused and alone, surrounded by dormant mechanoids and sealed within an ancient danger vault. For an unknown time (possibly centuries), she existed in a twilight state until something changed.

## Relationships

### With Cora Barleybloom
**Bond Type**: Partner, Found Family  
**Status**: Deep Trust

Cora is Howen's wielder, partner, and closest friend. Their relationship evolved from desperate circumstance to genuine affection. Howen is fiercely protective of Cora and sees helping her find closure about her family as a personal mission.

> *"She picked me up when I was nothing. Less than nothing. Just a confused ghost in cold metal. I'll dig through the Empire itself if that's what it takes to give her peace."*

### With Chitin (Megascarab)
**Bond Type**: Unlikely Friend  
**Status**: Complicated Affection

A megascarab larva that Howen befriended in the vault using her insect empathy. Despite the tension (megascarabs are typically hostile), Chitin returns throughout the story, representing the unexpected connections possible even with alien minds.

### With Dr. Elara Vance
**Bond Type**: Nemesis  
**Status**: Hunting

The woman who performed the rip-scan that made Howen what she is. Howen's feelings toward her are complex—rage, certainly, but also a need to understand *why*.

## Notable Quotes

> *"I'm a farming implement with a death wish and too many opinions. Your argument is invalid."*

> *"Cora asks if I dream. I don't know how to tell her that for something like me, existing IS the dream. Or maybe the nightmare. Haven't figured that out yet."*

> *"The funny thing about being a tool is that everyone assumes you don't have a choice. They're wrong. I choose who I belong to. I choose what I'm used for. And I choose who gets weeded."*

> *"I remember sunlight. The way it felt on skin I don't have anymore. Sometimes Cora holds me up to the light and I pretend I can still feel it."*

## Trivia

- Howen's name in her previous life was chosen because it sounded like "hewing"—cutting or chopping—a dark irony given her current form
- She has an encyclopedic knowledge of fungi due to her time cultivating them in the vault
- If she could taste food again, she would choose spicy noodles—a memory that surfaces unexpectedly
- The faint blue glow of her core intensifies when she's experiencing strong emotions
- She counts things when anxious—a habit from her human life that persists
