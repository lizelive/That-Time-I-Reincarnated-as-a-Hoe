## Background

### Pre-Awakening
Hodan has no memories of their life before becoming a persona weapon. They awakened in the Ancient Danger with no knowledge of their past, surrounded by dormant mechanoids and sleeping colonists.

### The Soul Forge Origin (Revealed in Arc 4)
Hodan was created in the Empire's Soul Forge, where human consciousness is forcibly transferred into weapons. Their original identity—name, life, memories—was deliberately erased. Charles Whitestone later suggests Hodan may have been someone significant, possibly a scientist involved in creating the very technology used against them.

### Life Philosophy
"I was made to farm. Whatever horrors created me, whatever atrocities birthed my existence—the result is someone who wants to help things grow. If the Empire intended to create a weapon of terror, they failed. I am a hoe. And I will till soil, plant seeds, and nurture life, no matter what tries to stop me."

- **Development**: From mysterious contact to trusted ally
- **Key Quote**: "He calls me 'old friend.' I believe him. I just don't remember why."

### The Empire (Creators/Enemies)

## Quotes

> "I have no arms with which to embrace. No eyes with which to see beauty. No voice with which to sing. But I have a consciousness that loves, and perhaps that is enough."

> "Being a hoe is... limiting. But every limitation forces creativity. I cannot fight like a sword, so I learned to think. I cannot protect like a shield, so I learned to nurture. I cannot kill like a gun, so I learned to grow."

> "Cora asked me once if I wished I were human again. I told her I don't know who I was—but I know who I am. And who I am is someone who loves her. That's enough."
