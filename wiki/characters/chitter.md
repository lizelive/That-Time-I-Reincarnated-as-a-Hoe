- Shows loyalty and protective behavior
- Responds to simple commands from Hodan (through soil-vibration communication)
- Displays curiosity and playfulness

- **Protective**: Positions between perceived threats and companions
- **Playful**: Enjoys rolling in loose soil, chasing small insects
- **Stubborn**: Resists being left behind

## Background

### Life in the Hive
Chitter originated from an insect hive that had established itself within the Ancient Danger, feeding on fungi and organic debris. Megascarabs are typically semi-social creatures, but Chitter appears to have been an outlier—more solitary and curious than its hive-mates.

### First Contact
Chitter accidentally knocked over Hodan during routine exploration, triggering Hodan's awareness expansion. This accidental interaction created a connection between them—Chitter became the first "friend" Hodan ever made.

### The Escape
When Cora's intrusion activated the mechanoid, Chitter played a crucial role in the escape:
- Drew centipede fire through distraction
- Created debris blockages that slowed pursuit
- Guided Cora through the safest path (communicating through Hodan)

### Beyond the Danger
After escaping, Chitter chose to follow Cora and Hodan rather than return to the hive. The megascarab adapted surprisingly well to surface life, farm life, Imperial life, resistance life, and eventually—improbably—space travel.

## Abilities

### Natural Abilities
- **Digging**: Can excavate soil rapidly
- **Crushing Strength**: Mandibles can break through wood and thin metal
- **Environmental Adaptation**: Tolerates wide range of temperatures and conditions
- **Low Metabolism**: Can survive extended periods without food

### Practical Applications
- **Farm Assistant**: Helps turn soil, clear debris
- **Pack Animal**: Carries supplies during travel
- **Early Warning**: Senses vibrations (enemies, weather changes)
- **Distraction Tactics**: Draws fire during combat

## Relationships

- **Bond Type**: Deep friendship across species barrier
- **Dynamic**: Hodan considers Chitter their first true friend; Chitter shows affection through proximity and protective behavior

- **Key Moments**: 
  - First contact (knocking Hodan over)
  - Distraction during Ancient Danger escape
  - Staying loyal across all arcs
- **Quote (Hodan)**: "Chitter doesn't understand philosophy. Chitter understands loyalty. Sometimes loyalty is the deeper wisdom."

### Cora (Secondary Companion)
- **Bond Type**: Mutual protection, working partnership
- **Dynamic**: Cora initially wary, grew to appreciate Chitter's usefulness and loyalty
- **Communication**: Cora reads Chitter's body language; Chitter responds to tone
- **Key Moments**: 
  - Chitter defending Cora during village attack

### The Insect Hive (Former Community)

## Quotes About Chitter

> "Chitter saved my life. A bug. A mindless insect saved my life because... I honestly don't know why. Because we're friends? Do bugs have friends? I think Chitter does. I think Chitter chose me." — Cora

> "The megascarab cannot speak. Cannot think in ways I understand. Cannot plan or dream or philosophize. But Chitter feels. Chitter loves, in whatever way a megascarab can love. And that love crossed species, crossed continents, crossed the void between stars. Tell me that isn't miraculous." — Hodan

> "The scarab? It's good luck. Lot of cultures think so. Maybe they're onto something." — Sergeant Vex
