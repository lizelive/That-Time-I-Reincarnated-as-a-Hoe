## Background

### Youth
Ashara was born to a neighboring tribe and married into Cora's village as a young woman. She adapted quickly, finding purpose in homemaking and community support.

### Marriage
Her husband (Cora and Finn's father) died before Finn was born—a hunting accident involving a pack of wild animals. Ashara raised both children alone, with support from the village.

### When Cora Returned
When Cora returned with a talking farming tool and a giant bug companion, Ashara's first response was to ask if Cora had eaten recently. Acceptance was assumed; practical care was the priority.

### Supporting Cora's Choices
Ashara supported Cora's decision to join the Empire, even knowing the risks. "You have to live your own life, daughter. I raised you to make good choices—now I have to trust that I did."

### When Cora Returned Again
Cora's second return—as a deserter from the Empire—was welcomed without judgment. Ashara understood that her daughter had seen something terrible and responded to it.

### The Final Sacrifice
During the Janissary attack, Ashara pushed Finn to safety and placed herself between the soldiers and Cora. A psychic blast meant for Cora struck Ashara instead. She died instantly—a final act of protection.
