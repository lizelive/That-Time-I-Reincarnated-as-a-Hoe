## Quotes

> "In the Empire, I healed soldiers so they could kill more efficiently. Here, I heal people so they can fight for something real. Same skills, different meaning."

> "The persona bond between you two is fascinating from a medical perspective. Your vital signs synchronize. Your stress responses mirror. It's like studying conjoined twins who can be separated at will."

> "I don't do hope. Hope is what you feel when you don't have data. I have data: our supplies are low, our people are tired, and the Empire has more of everything. What I do is *work*. Work doesn't need hope."
