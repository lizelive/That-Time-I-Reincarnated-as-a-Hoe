## Background

### Military Upbringing
Theron was identified for military potential at a young age. Raised in Imperial academies, he received conditioning designed to create perfect soldiers. Any personal history before conditioning is either forgotten or irrelevant.

### Rise Through Ranks
Theron's efficiency brought rapid promotion. He specialized in "pacification" operations—suppressing rebellions, hunting deserters, making examples. His success rate is near-perfect; his methods are not questioned.

### The Village Operation
Theron led the Janissary squad that attacked Cora's village. He executed the operation with standard protocols:
- Demand surrender
- Upon refusal, neutralize resistance
- Eliminate witnesses
- Salt the earth

The deaths of Grandmother Willow and Mother Ashara were, to Theron, simple tactical necessities.

## Relationships

### Cora (Target)
- **Bond Type**: Hunter and prey
- **Dynamic**: Theron views Cora as an objective, nothing more
- **Personal**: No emotional connection—she's simply a mission
- **Complication**: Her continued evasion is professionally irritating
- **Quote**: "The deserter will be found. The deserter will be processed. Emotional context is irrelevant."

### High Stellarch Mira (Superior)
- **Bond Type**: Subordinate officer
- **Dynamic**: Theron follows Mira's orders without question
- **Respect**: Professional appreciation for her power
- **Quote**: "The High Stellarch commands. I obey. This is proper function."

### His Janissaries (Command)
- **Bond Type**: Military commander
- **Dynamic**: His soldiers are tools, well-maintained and efficiently used
- **Loyalty**: They follow him because he keeps them alive and victorious
- **Quote**: "A soldier requires three things: orders, equipment, and a commander who does not waste their lives. I provide all three."

### The Empire (Purpose)
- **Bond Type**: Total devotion
- **Dynamic**: The Empire is not something Theron serves—it is his identity
- **Quote**: "Outside the Empire, I do not exist. I am the Empire's hand. The hand does not question the mind."

## Role in the Story

### Arc 5: Flowering
**Function**: Primary antagonist  
**Actions**: Leads the attack on Cora's village  
**Impact**: Kills Cora's mother and grandmother, crystalizing her transformation

### Arc 6-7: Background
**Function**: Persistent threat  
**Status**: Continuing to hunt deserters  
**Absence**: Does not appear directly; the threat of his pursuit drives urgency

## Motives

### Primary Motive: Mission Completion
Theron's purpose is executing assigned missions. Finding and capturing Cora is his current assignment.

### Secondary Motive: Imperial Order
Theron believes in the Imperial system—not ideologically, but functionally. Order requires enforcement.

### No Hidden Motive
There is no hidden depth to Theron. He is exactly what he appears: a weapon in human form.

### Tragic Element
The horror of Theron is not malice—it's absence. He is what the Empire creates when it strips away humanity and leaves only function.

## Quotes

> "The village harbored a deserter. The village refused to surrender the deserter. The village was neutralized. These are facts, not judgments."

> "I am told persona weapons have personalities. How inefficient. A weapon should not question its purpose."

> "Pain is information. Fear is information. Death is information. I process information and respond accordingly. Emotion is noise in the signal."
