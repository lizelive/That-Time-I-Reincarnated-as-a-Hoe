## Background

### Imperial Service
Vex served in the Imperial military for twenty years. He was a capable non-commissioned officer, skilled at training troops and executing operations. He never questioned orders—until he was forced to.

### The Breaking Point
Vex's unit was ordered to execute civilians who had failed to meet agricultural quotas. Among them were children. Vex refused. His superiors made an example of him: public torture, removal of fingers, discharge in disgrace.

### Founding the Deserters
Rather than disappear quietly, Vex gathered others who had broken with the Empire—soldiers who refused immoral orders, citizens who witnessed atrocities, anyone who could no longer serve the system. The Deserters became one of the most effective resistance groups in the sector.

### Years of Resistance
For over a decade, Vex led guerrilla operations against the Empire. His people struck supply lines, rescued prisoners, and spread sedition. They won no grand victories—but they survived, which was victory enough.

### Meeting Cora
When Cora arrived seeking the resistance, Vex was initially skeptical. Another angry young person with a vendetta. But he recognized something in her—the same cold determination he saw in his own mirror. He gave her a chance.

## Relationships

### Cora (Protégé/Ally)
- **Bond Type**: Military mentor
- **Dynamic**: Vex sees Cora's potential and channels it

  - Accepting her into the Deserters
  - Training her in guerrilla tactics
  - Trusting her with the Stellarch operation
- **Quote**: "You want revenge. I understand. But revenge that kills you is worthless. I'll teach you revenge that survives."

### Hodan (Tactical Asset/Wonder)
- **Bond Type**: Professional appreciation
- **Dynamic**: Vex views Hodan as an incredible strategic advantage
- **Significance**: A persona weapon fighting *against* the Empire has symbolic power
- **Quote**: "The Empire made you to serve them. You chose to defy them. That's the definition of freedom."

### Patch (Second-in-Command)
- **Bond Type**: Trusted lieutenant
- **Dynamic**: Patch handles what Vex can't—medical, morale, the human element
- **Partnership**: Complementary skills, shared history
- **Quote**: "Patch keeps us alive. I just point us at the enemy."

### The Deserters (Family)
- **Bond Type**: Found family, military unit
- **Dynamic**: Every resistance fighter is his responsibility
- **Weight**: Every death is personal
- **Quote**: "These people trusted me with their lives. I will not waste that trust."

### The Empire (Enemy/Former Home)
- **Bond Type**: Bitter opposition
- **Dynamic**: Vex knows the Empire from inside—its strengths, weaknesses, and horrors
- **Complexity**: Hates what the Empire is, mourns what it could have been
- **Quote**: "I gave them twenty years. They asked me to murder children. That's when I learned what they really are."

## Role in the Story

### Arc 6: Pollination

- Trains her in guerrilla warfare
- Approves and coordinates the Stellarch operation

### Arc 7: Dispersal
- Remains on planet while Cora escapes
- Continues the fight
- His fate is deliberately open-ended

## Motives

### Primary Motive: Resistance
Vex fights because stopping means the Empire wins. As long as he fights, freedom remains possible.

### Secondary Motive: Redemption
The years he served the Empire haunt him. Fighting against them is partial atonement.

### Hidden Motive: Hope
Despite cynicism, Vex hopes for victory. Not in his lifetime, perhaps—but someday. Cora's escape to the stars represents that hope: the resistance might reach beyond this planet.

## Quotes

> "The Empire calls us terrorists. Fine. If terror against tyrants is terror, I accept the label. But we don't target civilians—they do. Remember who burned your village."

> "You want to know the difference between us and them? When one of my people commits an atrocity, I execute them myself. When one of theirs does, they get promoted."

> "Go. Take your hoe, your bug, your ship. Get off this planet. Find other worlds, other people who will fight. We'll hold the line here. We'll hold it until we die, or until you come back with an army. Either way—we'll hold."
