## Background

### Long Life
Willow was born in the village and never left. She watched generations grow, marry, have children, and die. Her entire life was dedicated to her community and the sacred anima tree.

### The Anima Connection
Willow possessed natural psychic sensitivity—not the violent power of Imperial psylinks, but a gentle connection to life energy. She could sense illness, predict weather, and communicate (in a limited way) with the anima tree.

### Meeting Cora
When Cora returned with Hodan and Chitter, Grandmother Willow immediately sensed something different about the persona weapon. She did not fear Hodan but instead welcomed them as "a soul displaced, finding its way home."

### Teaching Cora
Willow taught Cora about natural psionics—the connection to anima trees that predates and surpasses Imperial technology. These lessons gave Cora an alternative to her artificial psylink.

### Final Stand
When Janissaries attacked the village, Grandmother Willow refused to flee. She positioned herself at the anima tree's base, using her connection to create a psychic shield. The effort was beyond her capabilities, and she died maintaining the shield long enough for others to escape—including, ultimately, the tree itself, which survived.

- **Impact**: Her acceptance helped the village accept Hodan
- **Quote**: "The tool speaks. The tool thinks. The tool feels. Tell me—where in that description do you find 'mere object'?"

## Death Scene

Grandmother Willow's death is one of the most emotionally significant moments in the story:

> *The old woman stood at the tree's base, arms raised, white hair streaming. Psychic energy crackled around her—not the violent blue of Imperial power, but a gentle green, the color of growth.*
> 
> *"Run," she commanded, and her voice carried authority it had never carried before. "I will hold them."*
> 
> *The Janissaries fired. The shield flickered. Grandmother Willow smiled.*
> 
> *"Thank you," she whispered to the tree. "For everything."*
> 
> *The shield shattered. But the moment it bought was enough—the survivors reached the forest, and the anima tree's deepest roots were beyond Janissary reach.*

## Quotes

> "The Empire claims to give power. The anima tree shares power. One demands payment; the other asks only presence. Which would you choose?"

> "I am old. I have watched children become parents become grandparents. I have seen droughts and floods and plagues. Do you think I fear soldiers? I fear only failing those who need me."

> "You ask what happens after death. I do not know—but I have felt the anima tree's roots, and they go deeper than any grave. Perhaps that is answer enough."
