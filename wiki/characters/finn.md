## Background

### Early Life
Finn was born during Cora's absence—she left for foraging, encountered the Ancient Danger, and didn't return for some time. When Cora finally came home with Hodan, Finn had grown into an energetic young boy who hero-worshipped his older sister.

### Learning from Cora
Finn wanted to be like Cora—a farmer, a trader, an adventurer. He followed her everywhere, learning about plants and asking endless questions. Hodan found his enthusiasm endearing.

### The Attack
During the Janissary assault, Finn was nearly killed. He survived only because Mother Ashara threw him to safety before dying herself. He witnessed her death and suffered serious injuries.

### After Cora Left
When Cora departed for Charles's ship, Finn begged to come. She refused—the journey was too dangerous for a child. Their parting was painful for both.

## The Farewell Scene

One of the story's most emotional moments:

> *"I want to come with you," Finn said, eyes red from crying.*
> 
> *Cora knelt to his level. "You can't. It's too dangerous."*
> 
> *"But you're leaving me! Like before!"*
> 
> *"I'm not—" Cora's voice broke. "I'm keeping you safe. The journey across the wastes... I can't protect you there."*
> 
> *"What if you don't come back?"*
> 
> *Cora pulled him close. "Then you remember what I taught you. You grow strong. You help people. You become better than I ever was."*
> 
> *"Promise you'll try to come back?"*
> 
> *"I promise I'll try."*
> 
> *It was not a promise of return—and both of them knew it.*

## Quotes

> "Cora, do you think the stars are like the anima tree? Grandmother Willow said the tree connects to something bigger. Maybe stars are like... sky trees?"

> "I'm not scared of bugs. Chitter is a bug and Chitter is my friend. Maybe all bugs can be friends if you're nice to them?"

> "Why did the bad soldiers hurt Mama? Mama never hurt anyone. Mama just made bread and sang songs and loved us. Why did they hurt her?"
