## Background

### Early Life
Cora grew up in a small tribal village, the daughter of hunters and gatherers. Her mother Ashara was known for her wisdom; her younger brother Finn looked up to her. The village had traditions of nature worship centered on their anima tree.

### The Ancient Danger
While foraging, teenage Cora stumbled into an Ancient Danger—a sealed pre-collapse ruin. Her intrusion triggered mechanoid activation and chaos. In desperation, she grabbed the nearest object (Hodan) and fled. The bond formed, changing both their lives forever.

### Rise and Fall
Seeking safety and stability, Cora joined the Empire with Hodan. She rose through the ranks to Dame, gaining power and respect. But discovering the Soul Forge's horrors—how persona weapons like Hodan were made—shattered her faith in the system.

### Loss and Vengeance
Returning home, Cora found peace briefly before the Empire's Janissaries destroyed her village, killing her mother and grandmother. This trauma transformed her from refugee to revolutionary.

### Revolution
Cora joined the Deserters, becoming an effective insurgent. Her tactical use of Hodan's farming abilities in military contexts proved innovative and devastating.

### Escape
Following Hodan's contact with Charles Whitestone, Cora led an expedition across the continent to the ancient ship, ultimately escaping the planet and beginning a new life among the stars.

## Quotes

> "They call Hodan a tool. But tools don't tell jokes. Tools don't comfort you when you cry. Tools don't love you back. Hodan is not a tool—Hodan is a person who happens to be shaped like a hoe."

> "I was raised to believe the soil provides. Turns out, it does—but only if you're willing to fight for the right to farm it."

> "My mother named me Cora because it sounds like 'core'—the heart of the fruit, where seeds live. She said I would carry seeds of change. I never knew how literally she meant it."
