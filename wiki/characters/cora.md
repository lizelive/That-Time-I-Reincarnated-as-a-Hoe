## Backstory

### Barleyhollow
Cora grew up in a small farming village called Barleyhollow, named for the golden fields that surrounded it. The village was independent, paying tribute to no faction, surviving through isolation and luck.

### The Barleybloom Family
- **Father (Holden)**: Village elder and master farmer. Taught Cora everything about growing things.
- **Mother (Senna)**: Healer and herbalist. Died of plague when Cora was 12.
- **Brother (Tomas)**: Older by three years. Cora adored him.
- **Grandmother (Nana Bloom)**: Keeper of old stories. Told Cora about the world before the collapse.

### The Burning
When Cora was 16, the **Shattered Empire** decided Barleyhollow's independence was an affront. A unit of Imperial troops arrived with a demand: tribute in goods, labor, and conscripts.

Her father refused.

The village was burned. The adults were executed. The children were taken as slaves. Cora escaped only because Tomas hid her in the root cellar and told her to stay quiet no matter what she heard.

She stayed quiet. She heard everything.

### Survival
For three years, Cora wandered. She worked fields for food, avoided patrols, trusted no one. She eventually found work at a small farmstead near an ancient danger site—work that put her in the path of a freshly-opened vault.

## Relationships

### With Howen
**Bond Type**: Partner, Found Family  
**Status**: Unbreakable Trust

At first, Cora thought Howen was just a strange tool that made her hungry. Learning the truth—that there was a person inside—changed everything. Howen is the first being she's trusted since Barleyhollow. Their bond transcends the wielder/weapon relationship.

> *"She's not a tool. She's my friend. My family. The only thing in this whole rim-forsaken world that hasn't let me down."*

### With Her Past
**Bond Type**: Trauma  
**Status**: Healing

Cora carries Barleyhollow with her always. The fire, the screams, Tomas's final act of love. Throughout the story, she slowly processes this grief, moving from victim to survivor to someone fighting for others who face the same fate.

### With Chitin
**Bond Type**: Wary Acceptance  
**Status**: Grudging Fondness

The megascarab is Howen's friend, which makes it Cora's... acquaintance. She's never fully comfortable around the giant insect, but she appreciates its loyalty and comes to respect it.

### With the Empire
**Bond Type**: Complex Hatred  
**Status**: War

Cora's relationship with the Empire is pure rage tempered by tactical patience. She wants it destroyed but learns that blind hatred serves no one. Her arc involves channeling that rage into effective action.

### With Charles Wheatstone
**Bond Type**: Respectful Alliance  
**Status**: Growing Trust

The noble who helps them escape the rimworld. Cora initially distrusts him—he's everything she should hate. But she learns that allies come in unexpected forms.

## Notable Quotes

> *"I didn't pick up a magic farming tool and become a hero. I picked up Howen and learned that even the smallest person—or smallest consciousness—can change the world. One seed at a time."*

> *"The Empire took everything. My home. My family. My childhood. They don't get to take my future."*

> *"I used to dream about Barleyhollow every night. The fire. The screams. Now I dream about fields again. Different fields. Fields we'll plant together."*

> *"Howen asks me what I'll do when this is over. I tell her I don't know how to think about 'over.' But maybe... maybe I'll grow barley again."*
