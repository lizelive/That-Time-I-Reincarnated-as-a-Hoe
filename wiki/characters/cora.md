## Personality

### Core Traits

- **Curious**: Her curiosity led her to discover Howen; it drives her to understand everything
- **Stubborn**: Once committed, she doesn't back down
- **Compassionate**: Cares deeply about others, sometimes to her detriment
- **Adapts**: Changes with circumstances without losing herself
- **Burns Hot**: Her anger, once roused, is formidable

### Internal Conflicts

1. **Survivor's Guilt**: Why does she survive when others die?
2. **The Cost of Power**: Is revenge worth what she's becoming?
3. **Trust vs. Pragmatism**: Can she open up to people again?
4. **Empire Indoctrination**: Unlearning things she was taught to believe

### Growth Arc

**Beginning**: Cora is reactive, driven by circumstance. She picks up Howen by accident and runs because she has no choice.

**Middle (Empire)**: She builds confidence, competence, and purpose—but within a corrupt system that flatters her growth.

**End**: She becomes proactive, choosing her battles, fighting for principles rather than survival, transformed into something dangerous to oppressors.

## Backstory

### The Barleybloom Tribe
Cora's ancestral people: farmers, traditionalists, and stubborn independents who refused to submit to Imperial tribute. They live in hidden valleys, maintaining old ways.

### Separation
Cora was separated from the tribe as a baby during an Imperial raid. She was found and raised by a rim settlement, never knowing her heritage until Arc 4.

### The Reunion (Arc 4)
After fleeing the Empire, Cora finds the Barleybloom Tribe—her family. Elder Barleybloom, her great-uncle, welcomes her home. For a week, she has everything she never knew she wanted.

### The Burning (Arc 4)
The Empire tracks her to the tribe and burns them for harboring a fugitive. Everything Cora gains, she loses again. This time, she decides to make someone pay.

## Relationships

### With Howen
**Bond Type**: Partner, Found Family, Soul-Bond  
**Status**: Unbreakable

What began as accidental discovery became the deepest relationship either has known. Through anima attunement, their bond becomes even more profound—Howen can feel through Cora, and Cora can think with Howen's precision.

> *"She's not a tool. She's not a weapon. She's my other half. The part that thinks when I feel too much."*

### With the Barleybloom Tribe (Memory)
**Bond Type**: Lost Family  
**Status**: Grief, Motivation

The tribe represents everything she could have had. Their loss fuels her fury.

### With Captain Vex
**Bond Type**: Mentor/Student  
**Status**: Respect, Growing Trust

Vex sees her younger self in Cora and pushes her hard to become the weapon she can be.

### With the Empire
**Bond Type**: Complex Hatred  
**Status**: War

She was seduced by their promises, believed their lies, benefited from their training. That makes the betrayal worse.
