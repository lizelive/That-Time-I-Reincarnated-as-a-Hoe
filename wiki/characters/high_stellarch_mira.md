## Background

### Rise to Power
Mira was born into the lower Imperial nobility. Through a combination of talent, ambition, and ruthlessness, she rose through the ranks to become one of the most powerful individuals in her sector. The "Seventeenth" in her title indicates she has held the position through sixteen succession challenges—a remarkable achievement.

### Imperial Philosophy
Mira genuinely believes in the Empire's mission: bringing order to chaos, civilization to barbarism. She views the Soul Forge's methods as unfortunate but necessary costs of progress. In her mind, the individuals sacrificed to create persona weapons serve a greater good.

### The Humiliation
When pirates attacked the colony she was visiting—tipped off by Cora's intelligence—Mira's reputation suffered catastrophically. Though she survived, her guards were decimated and the attack's success suggested vulnerability. For someone of her standing, this humiliation demands response.

## Relationships

### Cora (Enemy)
- **Bond Type**: Hunter and prey
- **Dynamic**: Mira initially viewed Cora as insignificant—just another deserter. After the pirate attack, Cora became personal.
- **Obsession**: Mira has dedicated resources to tracking Cora, though she doesn't know about Charles's ship
- **Quote**: "The tribal girl thinks she won. She merely postponed her reckoning."

### The Empire (Devotion)
- **Bond Type**: True believer
- **Dynamic**: Mira serves the Empire's interests because she genuinely believes in Imperial supremacy
- **Identity**: Her sense of self is inseparable from her role
- **Quote**: "I am the Empire. The Empire is me. To harm one is to harm both."

### Commander Theron (Subordinate)
- **Bond Type**: Superior officer
- **Dynamic**: Theron serves under Mira's command structure; his village destruction was partly her order
- **Trust**: Moderate—Theron is useful but ambitious
- **Quote**: "Theron has passion. Passion must be directed carefully, or it burns the wielder."

### Other Stellarchs (Rivals)
- **Bond Type**: Political competition
- **Dynamic**: Other sector leaders view Mira's humiliation as opportunity
- **Threat**: Her position is weakened; she must restore reputation or fall
- **Quote**: "My peers circle like carrion birds. They forget—I am not prey, I am predator."

## Role in the Story

### Arc 4: Growth (Background)
- Represents the pinnacle of Imperial power
- Symbol of what Cora could become or oppose

### Arc 5: Flowering (Indirect)
- Her military forces (Janissaries) destroy Cora's village
- Represents the Empire's punitive doctrine

### Arc 6: Pollination (Target)
- Primary target of the infiltration operation
- Humiliated by the pirate attack

### Arc 7: Dispersal (Absent)
- Does not appear directly
- Presumably hunting for Cora elsewhere
- Unaware of the escape into space

## Motives

### Primary Motive: Imperial Glory
Mira acts to strengthen the Empire and her position within it. These goals are functionally identical to her.

### Secondary Motive: Restoration
After the humiliation, restoring her reputation becomes paramount—this requires punishing those responsible.

### Hidden Motive: Fear
Deep beneath her confidence, Mira fears irrelevance. Life extension has given her centuries, but power can be stripped in moments.

### Failed Motive: Vengeance
Mira's desire to punish Cora is never satisfied—Cora escapes the planet before Mira can find her.

## Quotes

> "Desertion is not merely criminal. It is contagion. One deserter unpunished becomes a hundred. A hundred becomes a revolution. We do not permit contagion in the Imperial body."

> "The tribal peoples worship trees. The pirates worship profit. The rebels worship freedom. All false gods. Only the Empire is worthy of worship—because only the Empire endures."

> "I was attacked. I was humiliated. I was made to look *weak*. Someone will pay. If it takes a century, someone will pay."
