## History

### Founding
The village was established generations ago by a group seeking to live in harmony with nature. They discovered the anima tree and settled around it.

### Generations of Peace
For many decades, the village existed in relative peace. They avoided conflict with larger factions, traded cautiously, and maintained their traditional way of life.

### Cora's Childhood
Cora grew up in the village, learning to farm and forage. Her father died before Finn was born. When she stumbled into the Ancient Danger, her bond with Hodan changed everything.

### Cora's Departure
Cora left for the Empire, seeking power and security. The village continued without her, led by Grandmother Willow.

### Cora's Return
After deserting the Empire, Cora returned home. She was welcomed, though her psi powers and persona weapon made some uncomfortable.

### The Janissary Attack
Commander Theron's Janissaries attacked, demanding Cora's surrender. When the village refused:
- Buildings were burned
- Grandmother Willow was killed protecting the anima tree
- Mother Ashara was killed protecting Cora
- Many villagers died or fled
- The anima tree survived

### Aftermath
Survivors scattered to the forest. Some regrouped; others sought refuge elsewhere. The village as a community barely exists. The anima tree remains, waiting.

## Inhabitants (Pre-Attack)

|------|------|------|
| Grandmother Willow | Elder | Deceased |
| Mother Ashara | Cora's mother | Deceased |
| Finn | Cora's brother | Survived |
| Various hunters | Defense | Mixed |
| Various families | Community | Mixed |

## Significance

- **Stakes**: What Cora fights to protect/avenge
- **Loss**: Destruction motivates revolutionary arc

### Thematic Resonance
- **Nature vs. Empire**: Traditional life versus technological tyranny
- **Community vs. Individual**: Collective values versus Imperial hierarchy
- **Vulnerability**: Simple life cannot survive Imperial violence

## Quotes

> "The village had no walls. No weapons worth mentioning. No defenses except the forest and the anima tree's blessing. We thought nature would protect us. We were wrong." — Cora

> "I remember the smell of smoke, the screams, my mother's face as she pushed me away. I remember running, and then I remember nothing until I woke in the forest, alone." — Finn

> "We will rebuild. We always rebuild. That is what life does—it grows back. The Empire burns; we plant. Eventually, we will win." — Survivor
