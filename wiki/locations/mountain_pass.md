### Terrain Features

#### The Approach
- Forested foothills
- Moderate climbing
- Wildlife present but manageable
- Last chance to stock supplies

#### Lower Pass
- Exposed rock faces
- Narrow ledges in places
- Unpredictable weather
- Beginning of altitude effects

#### High Pass
- Snow and ice year-round
- Oxygen-thin atmosphere
- Extreme cold
- Maximum danger zone

#### Eastern Descent
- Unstable slopes
- Avalanche risk
- Rapid altitude change
- Exhaustion-related accidents common

## Hazards

### Environmental
| Hazard | Location | Severity |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Altitude Sickness** | High Pass | Severe |
| **Hypothermia** | Upper sections | Severe |
| **Avalanche** | Eastern Descent | Severe |
| **Falling** | Throughout | Fatal |
| **Storms** | Unpredictable | Severe |

### Wildlife
- **Snow Wolves**: Pack hunters, high aggression
- **Ice Bears**: Territorial, extremely dangerous
- **Mountain Cats**: Ambush predators
- **Various Birds**: Scavengers that follow travelers

### Navigation
- Poor visibility during storms
- Multiple false paths
- Easy to become lost
- No landmarks in whiteout conditions

## The Crossing

### Cora's Expedition
The journey through the pass was one of the most dangerous segments:

#### Party Composition (Start)
- Cora (leader, with Hodan)
- 8 Deserter volunteers
- Chitter

#### Challenges Faced
1. **Storm on Day 2**: Forced shelter in ice cave
2. **Snow Wolf Attack**: Lost one fighter
3. **Avalanche on Day 4**: Two more casualties
4. **High Altitude Sickness**: Several incapacitated
5. **Ice Bear Encounter**: Narrow escape

#### Survivors
- Cora
- Chitter
- 3 Deserters (5 lost)

### Hodan's Contribution
Hodan's abilities proved valuable:
- Soil sensing detected unstable ground
- Temperature awareness predicted storms
- Plant knowledge found edible roots
- Constant support kept Cora functional

## Historical Context

### Trade Route
Before the Empire's rise, merchants used this pass. Remains of old camps and shelters occasionally surface from snow.

### Current Use
- Rarely traveled
- No Imperial presence
- Used by smugglers and desperate travelers
- Considered impassable in winter

## Significance

### Narrative Function
- **Obstacle**: Major challenge in Dispersal arc
- **Loss**: Where companions died
- **Testing**: Proving Cora's determination

### Thematic Resonance
- **Nature's Indifference**: The mountains don't care
- **Cost of Freedom**: Every step toward escape has a price
- **Perseverance**: Continuing despite loss

## Quotes

> "I watched Mira fall. One moment she was beside me, the next she was tumbling down the slope. We couldn't stop. We couldn't go back. We just kept climbing." — Cora

> "The mountain doesn't hate you. It doesn't love you. It simply is. Every death on its slopes is our own fault—for being too weak, too slow, too human to survive." — Deserter survivor

> "I felt the snow's weight, the rock's instability, the approaching storm. I warned Cora. Sometimes she could avoid danger. Sometimes she couldn't. All I could do was help her face it." — Hodan
