## Quotes

> "This isn't much of a home. The beds are hard, the food is worse, and there's always someone on watch. But it's ours. It's free. That makes it better than any palace." — Deserter fighter

> "We survive because we're careful, we're mobile, and we're willing to die rather than surrender. The Empire has numbers. We have nothing to lose." — Sergeant Vex

> "When I arrived, someone handed me a bowl of terrible soup and said 'Welcome to the family.' No questions about my past, no judgment for my time in the Empire. Just... welcome. I almost cried." — Cora
