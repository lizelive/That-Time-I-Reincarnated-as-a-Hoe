## History

### Foundation
The capital was established during the Empire's expansion into this sector. Built on the ruins of pre-collapse settlement, it grew into the regional center of power.

### Growth
Centuries of development transformed it from frontier outpost to gleaming metropolis. The architecture reflects multiple eras of expansion.

### Current Era
The capital serves as base for sector governance. High Stellarch Mira operates from here when not traveling. All major decisions flow through this hub.

## Cora's Experience

### Arrival
Cora arrived as a sponsored commoner, awed by the technology and scale. The city represented everything her village was not—powerful, permanent, protected.

### Rise
Through the ranks, Cora experienced different levels:
- Common Quarter as newcomer
- Better lodging as Yeoman
- Merchant Quarter as Dame
- Access to Noble Quarter

### Discovery
Investigation led Cora and Hodan to the Soul Forge. The discovery shattered her faith in the Empire.

### Escape
Fleeing the capital required careful planning. The walls meant to keep enemies out also kept subjects in.

## Quotes

> "The towers are beautiful. I could not stop staring when I first arrived. Now I see them differently—each spire built on the souls of persona weapons, each light powered by suffering." — Cora

> "The capital has everything: food, safety, opportunity, technology beyond imagination. Everything except freedom. That's the cost of admission." — Hodan

> "Some people thrive here. They find the hierarchy comfortable, the rules reassuring, the power intoxicating. I understand them. I was almost one of them." — Cora
