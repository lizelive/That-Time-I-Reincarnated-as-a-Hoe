### The Fields
- **Size**: Several hectares, expanding over time
- **Crop**: Psychite plants (psychoid variety)
- **Yield**: Abnormally high due to Hodan's abilities
- **Quality**: Premium grade, sought by discerning buyers

### Processing Area
- **Drying Racks**: Where harvested leaves cure
- **Storehouse**: Inventory storage (burned by Crackpot)
- **Processing Shed**: Tea preparation
- **Sales Stall**: Direct customer interaction

## The Psychite Plant

### Biology
- **Family**: Unique rimworld species
- **Growth Cycle**: Fast-maturing, multiple harvests per season
- **Environment**: Adaptable, thrives in temperate zones
- **Danger**: Leaves cause addiction if consumed raw

### Products

| Product | Legality | Effect | Price |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Psychite Tea** | Legal | Mild stimulant, mood boost | Moderate |
| **Flake** | Illegal | Intense high, highly addictive | High |
| **Yayo** | Illegal | Processed stimulant, combat use | Very High |

Cora's operation focused exclusively on tea to maintain legality and avoid dangerous customers.

### Hodan's Enhancement
When Hodan guided the farming:
- Growth rate increased 300%
- Plant size exceeded normal by 50%
- Leaf potency improved significantly
- Pest resistance became near-perfect
- Yield per hectare far exceeded averages

## Operations

### Daily Work
1. **Morning**: Cora inspects fields, Hodan senses soil needs
2. **Midday**: Harvesting mature leaves
3. **Afternoon**: Processing and drying
4. **Evening**: Business planning, customer interaction

### Business Model
- Direct sales to travelers
- Contracts with regular merchants
- Premium pricing for quality
- Reinvestment into expansion

### Challenges
- **Raiders**: Attracted by valuable crop
- **Legality**: Fine line between tea and illegal products
- **Competition**: Other farmers jealous of success
- **Dependency**: Customers sometimes wanted more than tea
