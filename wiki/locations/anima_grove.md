### Atmosphere
- **Light**: Dappled sunlight through canopy, ethereal glow at dawn/dusk
- **Sound**: Wind through leaves, wildlife, subtle harmonic resonance
- **Sensation**: Tingling awareness, sense of being watched/welcomed
- **Smell**: Rich earth, flowering plants, something electric

## The Anima Trees

### Nature
Anima trees are a unique species found only on certain rimworlds. They possess:
- **Psychic Conductivity**: Channel and amplify psychic energy
- **Long Memory**: Store information across millennia
- **Semi-Sentience**: Not truly conscious but aware in some way
- **Connection Network**: Root systems link trees across vast distances

### The Great Tree
The largest anima tree in the region:
- **Age**: Estimated 2,000+ years
- **Size**: 60 meters tall, canopy visible for miles
- **Power**: Strongest psychic nexus in the territory
- **Guardian**: Protected by village traditions

### Lesser Trees
Smaller anima trees scattered through the grove:
- Support the great tree
- Serve as meditation sites
- May develop into great trees over centuries
- Connect to each other through roots

## Psychic Properties

### Natural Psionics
Connection with anima trees grants abilities:
- **Meditation**: Deep trance states
- **Empathy**: Sensing emotions of other connected beings
- **Nature Link**: Communication with animals and plants
- **Psychic Shield**: Natural protection from hostile powers

### Comparison to Imperial Psylinks

| Aspect | Anima Connection | Imperial Psylink |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Source** | Natural resonance | Technological implant |
| **Cost** | Time and devotion | Rank and compliance |
| **Stability** | Gentle, sustainable | Powerful but harsh |
| **Limitations** | Requires tree access | Works anywhere |
| **Side Effects** | Harmony with nature | Dependency on Empire |

### Cora's Experience
After receiving her Imperial psylink, Cora found it felt "wrong"—artificial and violent compared to her childhood memories of the anima tree. When she returned and connected naturally:

> "It was like coming home. The psylink screams power at you, demanding obedience. The anima tree whispers, invites, shares. Both give you abilities—but one gives freely, and the other takes as it gives."

## Traditions

### Village Practices
- **Coming of Age**: Young people meditate with the tree
- **Decision Making**: Elders consult the tree for guidance
- **Healing**: Sick and injured brought for recovery
- **Death**: Bodies buried among roots, returning to the network

### Grandmother Willow's Role
As Elder, Willow was the tree's primary interpreter:
- Maintained daily connection
- Translated tree's "wisdom" for others
- Protected the grove from exploitation
- Died defending the tree from Janissaries

## History

### Ancient Origins
The grove predates human settlement by millennia. Early settlers recognized its power and built their village nearby.

### Generations of Connection
Countless villagers have connected with the tree, adding their experiences to its memory. The tree "knows" everyone who ever touched it.

### The Janissary Attack
Commander Theron's forces attempted to destroy the tree:
- Grandmother Willow's shield prevented initial damage
- Janissaries focused on villagers instead
- Tree survived, partially burned
- Regeneration began immediately

### Current State
The great tree still stands, scarred but alive. The grove continues, waiting for those who seek connection.

## Significance

### Narrative Function
- **Alternative Power Source**: Shows that the Empire's way isn't the only way
- **Spiritual Anchor**: Grounds the story in something beyond politics
- **Inheritance**: What Cora carries forward from her people

### Thematic Resonance
- **Nature vs. Technology**: Organic connection versus mechanical implant
- **Tradition vs. Progress**: Old ways holding wisdom
- **Giving vs. Taking**: Contrast between anima sharing and Empire extraction

## Quotes

> "The psylink lets you reach into minds and tear. The anima tree lets you reach into minds and hold. Which would you choose?" — Grandmother Willow

> "I felt Hodan through the tree. The tree recognized them—not as a weapon, but as a consciousness. 'Displaced,' the tree seemed to say. 'Seeking roots.' And then it welcomed them as it welcomes all of us." — Cora

> "The Empire thinks they invented psychic powers. They just found a way to steal them. The trees were here first. The trees will be here last." — Village tradition
