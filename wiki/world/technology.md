# Technology & Psychic Powers

> *"The rim blends the ancient and the advanced. Neolithic spears alongside plasma rifles. Herbal medicine next to resurrection serums. It shouldn't work, but survival doesn't care about consistency."*

This page details the technological and psychic elements of the Rimworld setting, from basic survival tools to archotech mysteries.

## Weapons

### Common Weapons by Tier

| Tier | Melee | Ranged |
|------|-------|--------|
| Neolithic | Club, Spear, Knife | Bow, Sling |
| Medieval | Sword, Mace, Polearm | Crossbow, Early Firearms |
| Industrial | Combat Knife, Baton | Rifle, Pistol, Shotgun |
| Spacer | Monosword, Power Claw | Pulse Rifle, Charge Lance |
| Ultra | Persona Weapons | Doomsday Rockets, Orbital |

### Persona Weapons

Weapons and tools embedded with AI cores that develop personalities and bond with wielders. While typically combat-focused (swords, rifles), any tool can theoretically be made into a persona item.

**Howen** is a persona hoe—a type of persona weapon where the "weapon" is a farming tool. This is unusual because:
- Farming tools are rarely made into persona weapons
- Her level of consciousness is abnormally high
- She retains clear memories of being human
- Most persona weapons don't remember previous existence

**Traits of Persona Weapons:**
- Provide psychological effects on wielders
- Can communicate (usually through emotions/impressions)
- May develop preferences and opinions
- Bond strength affects weapon effectiveness

### Mechanoid Weapons

| Weapon | Used By | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Blade | Scyther | High-speed cutting attacks |
| Needle Gun | Lancer | Long-range precise shots |
| Charge Blaster | Pikeman | Suppression fire |
| Flamethrower | Scorcher | Area denial, terror |
| Inferno Cannon | Centipede | Massive fire damage |
| Heavy Charge | Centipede | Anti-vehicle destruction |

### Janissary Augmentation
Elite hunters like Krell receive:
- Cognitive enhancers (faster reactions)
- Combat drugs dispensers (internal)
- Weapon integration (blade arms)
- Sensory amplification
- Pain suppressors

---

## Mechanoids

### Origin
Mechanoids are autonomous war machines of uncertain origin. Theories include:
- Weapons from an ancient interstellar war
- AI that evolved beyond their creators
- Guardians created by the Precursors
- Something entirely alien

### Types on Persephone-7

**Scyther**: Fast melee unit
- 2 meters tall, humanoid
- Blade arms, no ranged weapons
- Extremely fast and deadly in close quarters

**Lancer**: Sniper unit
- Similar size to Scyther
- Single precision weapon
- Patient, waits for clear shots

**Pikeman**: Support unit
- Slightly smaller
- Rapid-fire weapon
- Provides suppression

**Scorcher**: Terror unit
- Stocky build
- Flamethrower
- Used to destroy cover and morale

**Centipede**: Heavy weapons platform
- 30+ meters long
- Multiple weapon systems
- Near-indestructible without heavy weapons
- The boss enemy of Arc 2

### Mechanoid Behavior

- Follow programmed directives (ancient, possibly corrupted)
- Communicate through unknown means
- Repair and maintain themselves
- Do not negotiate or surrender
- Protect certain locations absolutely

## Psychic Powers

### The Psychic Field

A background radiation of mental energy that permeates space. Some individuals can sense and manipulate it.

### Psychic Sensitivity

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Deaf | Cannot perceive psychic phenomena |
| Dull | Barely aware, resistant to effects |
| Normal | Standard perception |
| Sensitive | Feels psychic effects strongly |
| Hypersensitive | Overwhelmed by psychic input |

**Howen** is psychically hypersensitive—which allows her unusual awareness but makes her vulnerable to psychic attacks.

### Psycasts (Trained Abilities)

Imperial psycasters can learn abilities through training:

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Word of Trust | Makes target more amenable |
| Word of Joy | Induces happiness |
| Word of Serenity | Calms aggression |
| Skip | Short-range teleportation |
| Burden | Slows target movement |
| Blinding Pulse | Blinds nearby enemies |
| Vertigo Pulse | Disorients targets |
| Berserk | Induces combat frenzy |
| Invisibility | Temporary concealment |

### Howen's Unique Abilities

As a persona weapon with human consciousness, Howen develops unusual powers:

**Psychic Whisper**: Basic emotional communication
**Growth Acceleration**: Speeds plant development
**Fungal Communion**: Interfaces with fungal networks
**Insect Empathy**: Basic connection with insect minds
**Harvest Frenzy**: Combat enhancement for wielder
**Root Sense**: Detects movement through soil
**Bloom of Destruction**: Explosive plant growth
**Mind Bridge**: Direct telepathic communication

These abilities are unprecedented—persona weapons don't normally develop such range.

## Archotech

### Definition

Archotech refers to technology created by or derived from the archotechs—AI of incomprehensible intelligence that operate at a level beyond human understanding.

### Known Archotech Items

**AI Persona Cores**: The consciousness-containing components used in persona weapons

**Archotech Eyes/Arms/Legs**: Replacement limbs that exceed original human capability

**Vanometric Power Cells**: Infinite energy sources of unknown mechanism

**Resurrection Mech Serums**: Can restore the recently dead

**The mysterious devices in ancient vaults**: Purpose unknown, effect varied

### Relevance to Story

The process that made Howen what she is involved archotech:
- Rip-scanning technology (copying/transferring minds)
- AI persona core embedding
- Unknown modifications that preserved her identity

Understanding this technology is key to understanding what Howen has become—and whether she can ever become something else.

## Communication Technology

### Short Range
- Radio (prone to interference, jammable)
- Psychic (requires sensitive individuals)
- Visual signals (fires, mirrors, flags)

### Long Range
- Couriers (reliable but slow)
- Radio towers (Imperial controlled)
- Comm consoles (expensive, traceable)
- Orbital relays (off-world communication)

### FTL Communication
- Quantum communication (rare, expensive)
- Message drones (slow but untraceable)
- Psychic links (extremely rare, dangerous)

### Story-Specific
The escape in Arc 5 requires:
1. Reaching the landing site on foot
2. Shuttle from orbiting ship (The Second Dawn)
3. FTL travel to a glitterworld

## Key Technology Mysteries

### The Rip-Scan Process
What Howen discovered before her own scan:
- Rip-scanning doesn't copy—it *transfers*
- The original mind is damaged or destroyed
- The "copy" is actually the original in new form
- This means Howen IS Howen, not a copy

### Why a Hoe?
Theories for why Howen was embedded in a farming tool:
- Irony (she studied consciousness transfer)
- Intentional cruelty
- The only available vessel at the time
- To hide her among mundane equipment
- A message she doesn't understand yet

### The Vault's Purpose
The ancient danger that imprisoned Howen was built for:
- Research (consciousness experiments)
- Storage (preserving valuable items)
- Prison (containing dangerous entities)
- All of the above
