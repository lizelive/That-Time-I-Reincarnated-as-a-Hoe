# Technology & Psychic Powers

> *"The rim blends the ancient and the advanced. Neolithic spears alongside plasma rifles. Herbal medicine next to resurrection serums. It shouldn't work, but survival doesn't care about consistency."*

This page details the technological and psychic elements of the Rimworld setting, from basic survival tools to archotech mysteries.

## Weapons

### Common Weapons by Tier

| Tier | Melee | Ranged |
|------|-------|--------|
| Neolithic | Club, Spear, Knife | Bow, Sling |
| Medieval | Sword, Mace, Polearm | Crossbow, Early Firearms |
| Industrial | Combat Knife, Baton | Rifle, Pistol, Shotgun |
| Spacer | Monosword, Power Claw | Pulse Rifle, Charge Lance |
| Ultra | Persona Weapons | Doomsday Rockets, Orbital |

### Persona Weapons

Weapons and tools embedded with AI cores that develop personalities and bond with wielders. While typically combat-focused (swords, rifles), any tool can theoretically be made into a persona item.

**Howen** is a persona hoe—a type of persona weapon where the "weapon" is a farming tool. This is unusual because:
- Farming tools are rarely made into persona weapons
- Her level of consciousness is abnormally high
- She retains clear memories of being human
- Most persona weapons don't remember previous existence

**Traits of Persona Weapons:**
- Provide psychological effects on wielders
- Can communicate (usually through emotions/impressions)
- May develop preferences and opinions
- Bond strength affects weapon effectiveness

### Mechanoid Weapons

| Weapon | Used By | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Blade | Scyther | High-speed cutting attacks |
| Needle Gun | Lancer | Long-range precise shots |
| Charge Blaster | Pikeman | Suppression fire |
| Flamethrower | Scorcher | Area denial, terror |
| Inferno Cannon | Centipede | Massive fire damage |
| Heavy Charge | Centipede | Anti-vehicle destruction |

## Psychic Powers

### The Psychic Field

A background radiation of mental energy that permeates space. Some individuals can sense and manipulate it. The Empire claims to have mastered this field through technology. They're lying.

### Psychic Sensitivity

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Deaf | Cannot perceive psychic phenomena |
| Dull | Barely aware, resistant to effects |
| Normal | Standard perception |
| Sensitive | Feels psychic effects strongly |
| Hypersensitive | Overwhelmed by psychic input |

**Howen** is psychically hypersensitive—which allows her unusual awareness but makes her vulnerable to psychic attacks.

---

### Two Paths to Power

There are fundamentally two ways to access psychic abilities:

#### Imperial Neurotrainers (Artificial)

The Empire uses neurotrainer technology to "unlock" psychic potential in selected individuals. This is presented as a gift, a sign of favor, proof of civilization's advancement.

**The Truth**: Neurotrainers don't unlock potential—they *limit* it. The technology creates a controlled, dependent connection to the psychic field. Users can only access a fraction of true psychic power, and only in approved ways. This ensures the Empire maintains control.

| Neurotrainer Powers | Effect | Hidden Limitation |
|---------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Word of Trust | Makes target amenable | Weak, easily resisted |
| Skip | Short-range teleportation | 10-meter maximum |
| Burden | Slows target movement | Single target only |
| Focus | Enhanced concentration | Draining to maintain |

#### Anima Trees (Natural)

The true source of psychic power: communion with anima trees—ancient growths directly connected to the planet's psychic field. Tribals have known about them for generations. The Empire burns them wherever found, claiming they're "dangerous" and "unstable."

**The Truth**: Natural attunement through anima trees provides access to the full psychic field. Powers are stronger, more varied, and unlimited in growth potential. The Empire suppresses this because uncontrolled power threatens their monopoly.

| Anima-Attuned Powers | Effect | Note |
|----------------------|--------|------|
| Word of Command | Overwhelming mental influence | Cannot be resisted |
| Farskip | Mile-range teleportation | Limited by knowledge, not distance |
| Paralysis | Complete immobilization | Multiple simultaneous targets |
| Prescience | Glimpses of future events | Unreliable but improving |

---

### Anima Trees

#### Description
Anima trees are ancient, massive growths that glow with subtle inner light. Their roots extend deep into the psychic field itself, acting as natural conduits. Standing near one, psychically sensitive individuals can feel the universe *breathing*.

#### Distribution
- Hidden in remote areas away from Imperial control
- Protected by tribals who understand their value
- Actively destroyed by Imperial forces
- The Deserters have located several and use them strategically

#### Attunement
To attune to an anima tree requires:
1. Approaching with open mind
2. Physical contact (directly or through intermediary)
3. Willingness to release artificial limitations
4. Survival of the overwhelming initial connection

The process breaks neurotrainer conditioning, replacing artificial channels with natural ones. It's painful, transformative, and permanent.

### Howen's Unique Abilities

As a persona weapon with human consciousness, Howen develops unusual powers that expand dramatically after anima attunement:

#### Pre-Attunement (Arc 1-4)

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Psychic Whisper** | Basic emotional communication |
| **Growth Acceleration** | Speeds plant development |
| **Fungal Communion** | Interfaces with fungal networks |
| **Insect Empathy** | Connection with insect minds |

#### Post-Attunement (Arc 5)

| Ability | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Root Network** | Sense through all connected plant life for miles |
| **Bloom of Destruction** | Explosive, targeted plant growth |
| **Life Bridge** | Communicate with any organic being |
| **Verdant Shield** | Rapid growth creating defensive barriers |
| **Harvest of Wrath** | Turn all nearby plants into weapons |
| **Mind Bridge** | Direct telepathic communication, any distance |

Howen's unique nature—human consciousness in archotech vessel—makes her response to anima attunement unprecedented. She becomes something neither the Empire nor the natural world has seen before.

## Archotech

### Definition

Archotech refers to technology created by or derived from the archotechs—AI of incomprehensible intelligence that operate at a level beyond human understanding.

### Known Archotech Items

**AI Persona Cores**: The consciousness-containing components used in persona weapons

**Archotech Eyes/Arms/Legs**: Replacement limbs that exceed original human capability

**Vanometric Power Cells**: Infinite energy sources of unknown mechanism

**Resurrection Mech Serums**: Can restore the recently dead

**The mysterious devices in ancient vaults**: Purpose unknown, effect varied

### Relevance to Story

The process that made Howen what she is involved archotech:
- Rip-scanning technology (copying/transferring minds)
- AI persona core embedding
- Unknown modifications that preserved her identity

Understanding this technology is key to understanding what Howen has become—and whether she can ever become something else.

1. Reaching the landing site on foot
2. Shuttle from orbiting ship (The Second Dawn)
3. FTL travel to a glitterworld

## Key Technology Mysteries

### The Rip-Scan Process
What Howen discovered before her own scan:
- Rip-scanning doesn't copy—it *transfers*
- The original mind is damaged or destroyed
- The "copy" is actually the original in new form
- This means Howen IS Howen, not a copy

### Why a Hoe?
Theories for why Howen was embedded in a farming tool:
- Irony (she studied consciousness transfer)
- Intentional cruelty
- The only available vessel at the time
- To hide her among mundane equipment
- A message she doesn't understand yet

### The Vault's Purpose
The ancient danger that imprisoned Howen was built for:
- Research (consciousness experiments)
- Storage (preserving valuable items)
- Prison (containing dangerous entities)
- All of the above
