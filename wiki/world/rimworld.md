## History

### Pre-Colonial Era (Unknown - 300 years ago)

Before human colonization, Persephone-7 was home to:
- The Precursors: An ancient civilization that left archotech ruins
- The Mechanitors: A human-AI hybrid culture (estimated 2000 years old)
- Unknown builders: Structures too old to date

### First Wave (300 years ago)

Colony ships from the Glitterworld Consortium established initial settlements. The first century saw rapid expansion and prosperity.

### The Collapse (200 years ago)

Multiple disasters struck within a decade:
- Mechanoid awakening from dormant sites
- Psychic storm events disrupting communication
- Political fracturing as central authority failed
- Population declined by 70%

### The Recovery (200-50 years ago)

Survivors rebuilt in isolation. Different groups developed different strategies:
- Some maintained technology
- Some reverted to tribalism
- Some became raiders and outlaws

### The Empire Arrives (50 years ago)

The **Shattered Empire**, a stellar nation, established a permanent presence. They claimed to bring civilization but brought conquest.

### Current Era (Now)

Persephone-7 is a contested world where:
- The Empire controls key settlements and trade routes
- Independents struggle to maintain autonomy
- Tribals defend their traditional lands
- Mechanoids lurk in ancient sites
- Outlanders prey on the weak
