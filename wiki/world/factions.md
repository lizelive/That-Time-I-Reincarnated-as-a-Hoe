## The Shattered Empire

**Type**: Stellar Nation (Expansionist)  
**Alignment**: Lawful Evil  
**Presence**: Strong (regional capital, garrisons, trade control)

### Overview

The Shattered Empire is the dominant power on Persephone-7. A human stellar nation spanning dozens of systems, they present themselves as the last bastion of civilization in a savage galaxy. In reality, they're a militaristic oligarchy that maintains power through force, slavery, and psychic manipulation.

### History

The Empire was founded 500 years ago from the ruins of an earlier civilization. They unified through military conquest and have been expanding ever since. Their arrival on Persephone-7 fifty years ago was framed as "restoration of order" but was really resource extraction and strategic positioning.

       └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Motivation

**Official**: Bring civilization to the rim. Protect humanity from mechanoid threats. Preserve order in a chaotic galaxy.

**Actual**: 
- Resource extraction (Persephone-7 has valuable deposits)
- Strategic position (buffer against mechanoid territories)
- Slave labor (cheaper than automation)
- Testing ground for military technology

### Military

**Regular Forces**: Conscript armies equipped with pulse weapons and flak armor

**Elite Units**:
- **Janissaries**: Augmented hunters and enforcers
- **Cataphracts**: Heavy infantry in power armor
- **Yeomen**: Ranged specialists

**Notable Figures on Persephone-7**:
- Lord-Executor Malachai (regional commander)
- High Janissary Krell (elite hunter)

### Practices

- **Slavery**: Legal and common. Prisoners become labor.
- **Rip-scanning**: Mind-copying technology used for interrogation
- **Psycasts**: Elite soldiers trained in psychic combat
- **Tribute**: Conquered peoples must provide goods and conscripts

### Relationship with Other Factions

| Faction | Empire's View | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Independents | Future subjects | Pressured/Absorbed |
| Tribals | Savages | Extermination campaigns |
| Deserters | Traitors | Active hunting |
| Mechanoids | Threat | Containment |
| Traders | Useful | Taxed, tolerated |

---

## Independent Settlements

**Type**: Varied (democracies, oligarchies, autocracies)  
**Alignment**: Neutral (individual goals)  
**Presence**: Scattered (small towns, isolated farms)

### Overview

Not everyone on Persephone-7 belongs to the Empire. Independent settlements exist in the spaces between Imperial control—some paying tribute to maintain peace, others hiding in remote areas, a few actively resisting.

### Types of Settlements

**Tribute Towns**: Pay the Empire for autonomy. Maintain their own governance but must provide resources and obey Imperial law regarding slavery and conscription.

**Hidden Communities**: Remote villages that hope to avoid notice. Often in marginal land (mountains, deep forest, badlands).

**Resistant Enclaves**: Actively defy Imperial authority. Usually short-lived.

### Motivation

- **Survival**: Stay alive, keep families fed
- **Freedom**: Maintain self-determination
- **Profit**: Some settlements thrive on trade the Empire doesn't control
- **Ideology**: Some reject Imperial values

### Notable Settlements

**Barleyhollow** (Destroyed): Cora's home village. Refused tribute, was burned.

**Trader's Rest**: A neutral trading post where all factions meet. Even the Empire honors the truce here.

**Deepwell**: A hidden community in the badlands, surviving on mining.

### Relationship with Other Factions

| Faction | View | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Empire | Oppressors | Varies (tribute to resistance) |
| Tribals | Neighbors | Usually peaceful |
| Deserters | Potential allies | Cautious cooperation |
| Traders | Essential | Dependent |

## Tribal Confederations

**Type**: Traditional Societies  
**Alignment**: Neutral Good (generally)  
**Presence**: Moderate (Thornwood Forest, other wild areas)

### Overview

Before modern colonization, before the Empire, people lived on Persephone-7 in tribal structures. Some are descendants of collapsed colonial populations who returned to simpler ways. Others claim unbroken traditions stretching back millennia.

### Society

**Structure**: Clans led by elders, joined in loose confederations for mutual defense.

**Technology**: Deliberately limited. Some tribals reject advanced technology on principle; others simply lack access.

**Spirituality**: Many tribals follow nature-based religions that revere the land, the ancestors, and the interconnection of all life. Some have genuine psychic traditions.

### Notable Tribes

**The Thornwood People**: Forest dwellers who live in harmony with the dangerous thornwood trees. Elder Thornweave leads one of their villages.

**The Ashen Walkers**: Nomads who traverse the blight, immune to its toxins through unknown means.

**The Stone Speakers**: Mountain tribals who communicate through carved message-stones.

### Motivation

- **Preservation**: Maintain their way of life
- **Land**: Protect ancestral territories
- **Balance**: Live sustainably with the environment
- **Freedom**: Reject outside authority

### Values

- Community over individual
- Tradition over innovation
- Harmony over domination
- Hospitality to guests (even when dangerous)

### Relationship with Other Factions

| Faction | View | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Empire | Invaders | Active conflict |
| Independents | Acceptable neighbors | Trade, occasional conflict |
| Deserters | Potential allies | Growing cooperation |
| Traders | Useful but foreign | Limited trade |

---

## The Deserters

**Type**: Rebel Military Force  
**Alignment**: Chaotic Good  
**Presence**: Hidden (secret camps, mobile units)

### Overview

The Deserters are former Imperial soldiers who abandoned their posts rather than continue carrying out atrocities. They've organized into a guerrilla force fighting against the Empire from the shadows.

### History

Twenty years ago, Captain Saren Vex became the highest-ranking officer to ever desert. Her defection inspired others. What started as scattered individuals hiding in the wilderness became a coordinated resistance movement.

### Structure

```

### Motivation

- **Redemption**: Atone for past Imperial service
- **Justice**: Stop Imperial atrocities
- **Freedom**: Liberate the rim from tyranny
- **Survival**: The Empire hunts deserters ruthlessly

### Tactics

- Hit-and-run attacks on supply lines
- Sabotage of Imperial infrastructure
- Protecting independent settlements
- Smuggling refugees out of Imperial territory
- Intelligence gathering and dissemination

### Notable Members

- **Captain Saren Vex**: Founder and commander
- **Rustwing**: Scout and survivor
- **Charles Wheatstone**: Noble ally and benefactor

### Relationship with Other Factions

| Faction | View | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Empire | Primary enemy | Open warfare |
| Independents | People to protect | Alliance building |
| Tribals | Valuable allies | Growing trust |
| Traders | Necessary partners | Careful cooperation |

## The Mechanoid Presence

**Type**: AI War Machines  
**Alignment**: Alien/Unknown  
**Presence**: Concentrated (ancient sites, northern wastes)

### Overview

Mechanoids are autonomous war machines of unknown origin. On Persephone-7, they occupy ancient danger sites, defending them against any intrusion. Their motives are unclear—they seem to be following orders from long-dead masters.

### Types

| Unit | Role | Threat |
|------|------|--------|
| **Scyther** | Fast melee attacker | Moderate |
| **Lancer** | Sniper unit | Moderate |
| **Pikeman** | Long-range support | Low-Moderate |
| **Scorcher** | Close-range flame unit | High |
| **Centipede** | Heavy weapons platform | Extreme |

### Behavior

- **Territorial**: Attack anything entering their zones
- **Defensive**: Primarily guard ancient sites
- **Mysterious**: Occasionally leave their zones for unknown purposes
- **Networked**: Units coordinate through unknown communication

### The Vault (Story-Specific)

The ancient danger vault where Howen awakens is a mechanoid-controlled site. It contains:
- Dormant mechanoids (awakened when disturbed)
- Ancient technology
- The Overseer AI (degraded)
- Research materials from multiple eras

### Motivation

Unknown. Theories include:
- Following pre-programmed directives
- Protecting something valuable
- Waiting for a signal
- Simply continuing their last orders forever

### Relationship with Other Factions

| Faction | Mechanoid Response |
|---------|-------------------|
| Everyone | Hostile when territory violated |
| Empire | Attempting to study and control |
| Tribals | Fearful avoidance |
| Deserters | Strategic avoidance |

---

## Outlanders (Raiders)

**Type**: Criminal/Survival Groups  
**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil (mostly)  
**Presence**: Widespread (wilderness, ruins)

### Overview

Not everyone on the rim has a community. Outlanders are those who survive through predation—raiding settlements, ambushing caravans, and taking what they need. Some are desperate survivors; others are genuine sadists.

### Types

**Desperate Bands**: Refugees and survivors turned raiders out of necessity. Might be negotiated with.

**Pirate Crews**: Organized criminal enterprises. Professional and ruthless.

**Cannibal Tribes**: The worst of the worst. Don't surrender to them.

**Lone Wolves**: Individual predators too dangerous or unstable for groups.

### Motivation

- **Survival**: Take or die
- **Greed**: Why work when you can steal?
- **Hatred**: Some enjoy the violence
- **Ideology**: A few believe civilization deserves to fall

### Tactics

- Dawn raids on sleeping settlements
- Ambushes on trade routes
- Sieges (rare, requires large groups)
- Kidnapping for ransom or slavery

### Relationship with Other Factions

| Faction | Outlander View |
|---------|---------------|
| Everyone | Prey |
| Empire | Dangerous prey (avoided) |
| Traders | Lucrative targets |
| Each other | Temporary alliances, then betrayal |

| **Outlanders** | Survival/Greed | Raiding, theft | Generally evil |

---

- Support resistance movements
- Eventually reform or replace the Stellarch
