# World Building

> *"The rim is called that for a reason. We're on the edge—of civilization, of survival, of sanity."*

This section details the world in which **The Time I Reincarnated as a Hoe** takes place. The setting is a rimworld—a planet on the outer edge of human-colonized space, far from the urbanworlds and glitterworlds where technology and stability reign.

## Quick Overview

### The Planet: Persephone-7

Named for the goddess who walked between worlds, Persephone-7 is a temperate rimworld settled over three hundred years ago. Its environment ranges from lush forests to arid badlands, with ruins of multiple failed civilizations scattered across its surface.

**Key Facts:**
- **Stellar Position**: Outer rim, 47 days from nearest relay
- **Population**: ~50,000 (estimate; no census exists)
- **Tech Level**: Mixed (spacer enclaves to neolithic tribes)
- **Primary Resources**: Fertile soil, ancient ruins, psychically active fauna

### The Political Landscape

Power on Persephone-7 is divided among:

1. **The Shattered Empire**: An expansionist stellar nation maintaining control through military might
2. **Independent Settlements**: Towns and villages clinging to autonomy
3. **Tribal Confederations**: Traditional peoples living off the land
4. **The Mechanoid Presence**: AI war machines occupying ancient sites
5. **Outlanders**: Raiders, pirates, and those outside any system

### The Cosmic Context

Persephone-7 exists in a universe where:
- Faster-than-light travel is possible but expensive
- Psychic abilities are real and can be cultivated
- AI ranges from helpful to hostile to unknowable
- Ancient civilizations left dangerous technology behind
- Life is cheap, but hope endures

## Themes in World Building

### Technological Disparity
On the same planet, you might find:
- Tribals using bows and spears
- Settlers with gunpowder weapons
- Imperial soldiers with pulse rifles
- Mechanoids with plasma weaponry
- Ancient archotech that defies understanding

This creates constant tension as factions compete not just for land but for technological advantage.

### The Weight of History
Persephone-7 is layered with ruins:
- The original colonists (300 years ago)
- The First Empire (collapsed 200 years ago)
- The Mechanitor civilizations (thousands of years old)
- Something even older, barely understood

Every dig site might yield treasure or terror.

### Nature as Character
The planet itself shapes events:
- Toxic fallout from ancient wars
- Psychically active fauna (megascarabs, thrumbos)
- Seasons that can kill the unprepared
- Diseases that decimate populations

Survival isn't just about defeating enemies—it's about enduring the world itself.
