  "reference_prompt": "A battle-hardened woman in her late thirties stands in defiant command, her short-cropped dark hair streaked with premature gray. A severe burn scar runs from her left temple down her neck, the skin there tight and discolored. Her eyes hold cold fury and absolute determination. She wears modified Imperial power armor, its original insignia spray-painted over with crude Deserter symbols in red. Her posture speaks of military discipline turned to revolutionary purpose. Dramatic side lighting emphasizes the texture of her scar and the weathering on her armor, while casting half her face in determined shadow. Style: Military portrait, rebellion aesthetic. Mood: Vengeful, commanding, unbroken.",
