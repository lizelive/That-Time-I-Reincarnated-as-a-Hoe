  "reference_prompt": "A coldly beautiful woman in her fifties stands in a sterile laboratory, her silver hair pulled back in a severe style that emphasizes her sharp, calculating features. Pale skin that rarely sees natural light gives her an almost spectral quality. Her left eye has been replaced with a bionic implant that glows faint blue, constantly recording. She wears pristine white Imperial researcher robes that fall to her ankles, concealing a gray bodysuit beneath. Her expression holds clinical detachment, viewing the world as a series of experiments. Cold clinical lighting from above creates harsh shadows under her cheekbones and reflects off her bionic eye. Style: Scientific horror portrait, clinical aesthetic. Mood: Cold, calculating, inhuman.",
