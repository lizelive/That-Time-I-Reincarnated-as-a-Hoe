A single cyclopean sensor glows orange-red where a face would be. Heat vents along its torso pulse with inner fire, while fuel tanks on its back gleam with deadly potential. The creature's posture suggests predatory intent, flamethrower raised and ready. Warm orange lighting from its own heat vents illuminates the smoke rising from its chassis, while harsh shadows define its inhuman angles. Style: Military science fiction, fire elemental machine.
