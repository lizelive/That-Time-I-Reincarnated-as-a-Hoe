  "reference_prompt": "A hidden grove of anima trees stands in ancient majesty, their pale bark covered in naturally occurring geometric patterns that seem to shift when not directly observed. Soft inner light pulses through each tree in synchronized rhythm, creating waves of gentle illumination. Anima grass carpets the entire grove floor, each blade glowing with psychic potential that ebbs and flows like breathing. The air itself shimmers with visible psychic energy, distorting the background like heat waves. Strange wildlife—drawn to the power—watches from the grove's edges with unusual intelligence in their eyes. Ethereal light emanates from multiple sources, creating an otherworldly glow with no harsh shadows, only gentle gradients of luminescence. Style: Sacred space visualization, psychic naturalism. Mood: Transcendent, powerful, alive, transformative.",
