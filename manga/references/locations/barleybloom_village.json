  "reference_prompt": "A peaceful tribal village nestles in a fertile valley, thatched-roof buildings of wood and stone arranged around a central gathering area with a fire pit. Small gardens and carefully tended farms surround the settlement, showing generations of agricultural knowledge. At the village heart, an ancient anima tree rises with otherworldly grace, its trunk marked with carved symbols, surrounded by a ring of softly glowing anima grass. Villagers in practical woven clothing tend to daily tasks. Warm golden afternoon light filters through the anima tree's canopy, while the grass below pulses with gentle psychic luminescence. Style: Pastoral tribal settlement, mystical naturalism. Mood: Peaceful, welcoming, ancestral, doomed.",
