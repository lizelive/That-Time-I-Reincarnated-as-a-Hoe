  "visual_description": "An ancient pre-collapse vault buried underground. Dark metal walls with faded warning symbols. Rows of cryptosleep caskets, some damaged or open. Thick dust covers everything. Bioluminescent mushrooms (grown by Howen) provide purple-blue light. A massive dormant Centipede mechanoid lurks in the deeper sections.",
  "reference_prompt": "An ancient underground vault stretches into darkness, its walls of dark metal bearing faded warning symbols in languages long forgotten. Rows of cryptosleep caskets line the walls, some cracked open, others dark and dead. Thick dust covers every surface, disturbed only by recent footprints. Clusters of bioluminescent mushrooms grow from cracks in the floor, casting the space in ethereal purple-blue light that creates long shadows. Ancient machinery hums with residual power in the darkness beyond. The air itself feels heavy with centuries of sealed stillness. Style: Science fiction archaeology, survival horror aesthetic. Mood: Ancient, dangerous, secrets waiting.",
