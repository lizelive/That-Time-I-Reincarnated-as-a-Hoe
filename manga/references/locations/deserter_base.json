  "reference_prompt": "A hidden military encampment spreads through a rocky canyon, camouflaged from above by netting and natural overhangs. Salvaged Imperial equipment sits alongside jury-rigged defenses—modified vehicles, repurposed weapons, improvised armor. Tents and prefab shelters cluster in protected alcoves where Deserter soldiers train and plan. Spray-painted symbols of defiance mark every surface. In a protected grotto nearby, an intact anima tree glows with soft psychic light, carefully hidden and reverently tended. The whole base speaks of desperate determination and righteous fury. Harsh daylight filters through the camo netting, creating dappled patterns of light and shadow across the military gear. Style: Guerrilla military camp, resistance aesthetic. Mood: Defiant, desperate, determined, vengeful.",
