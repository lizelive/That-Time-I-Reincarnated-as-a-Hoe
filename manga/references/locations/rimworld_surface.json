  "reference_prompt": "A sweeping vista of an alien frontier world spreads to the horizon, rugged terrain marked by weathered rocky outcrops and hardy vegetation in muted greens and ambers. The sky carries a subtle amber tint, two small moons visible even in daylight. Unfamiliar plants with thick leaves cluster around water sources, while scattered ruins of forgotten civilizations dot the landscape—reminders that others came before and failed. Golden hour sunlight washes across the scene, casting long shadows from the rocks and painting the alien flora in warm tones. Style: Science fiction landscape, frontier wilderness aesthetic. Mood: Vast, dangerous, beautiful, unforgiving.",
