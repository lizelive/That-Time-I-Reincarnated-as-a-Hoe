Cora grips Howen tight as they run through the vault, purple mushroom light strobing as they pass. Behind them, the war machine unfolds its weapons. A Scorcher mechanoid joins the pursuit, heat shimmer visible around its flamethrower. Chaos of red warning lights, purple mushroom glow, and the blue flash of Howen's terrified light. Style: Action horror, pursuit sequence. Mood: Terror, urgency, survival.",
