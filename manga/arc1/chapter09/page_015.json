The floor collapses under the war machine's weight, ancient metal giving way. The Centipede falls, scrabbling at the edges, red sensors flashing in rage. Cora and Howen watch from safety. Dramatic collapse lighting, red mechanoid lights falling into darkness, dust rising. Style: Trap springing, victory moment. Mood: Triumphant, relieved, costly.",
