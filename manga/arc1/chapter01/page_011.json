  "prompt": "Howen extends her senses outward into the darkness, and faint shapes begin to emerge—large rectangular objects arranged in rows, their surfaces dusty and ancient. Cryptosleep caskets, though she doesn't recognize them yet. Some appear intact, others cracked or broken open. The blue glow reaches toward them, revealing hints of their structure. Soft blue light stretches outward, catching edges of rectangular shapes, dust-covered surfaces, the geometry of organized storage. Style: Environment discovery, ancient technology reveal. Mood: Exploration, mystery, the dead around her.",
