  "prompt": "Howen's blue glow dims instinctively, pulling back, trying to hide—a prey response to a predator. The mechanoid doesn't stir, its sensors remaining dark. Relief mixes with continued fear as the massive shape stays dormant. The darkness feels protective now. Blue light reduced to minimum, the vast mechanoid shape still and silent, darkness wrapping around like a protective blanket. Style: Hiding behavior, survival instinct. Mood: Fear, relief, caution.",
