  "prompt": "The blue glow stabilizes, finding a steady rhythm like a slow heartbeat—calm returning through force of will. The light holds steady, no longer flickering, casting a small but consistent sphere of illumination. Within this calm glow, details become clearer: the texture of ancient metal, the geometry of technology, the weight of centuries in the dust. The perspective settles, stabilizes, becomes coherent. Steady blue light pulses in a measured rhythm, creating reliable shadows that define the space. Style: Stabilization moment, willpower visualization. Mood: Determined calm, the decision to survive.",
