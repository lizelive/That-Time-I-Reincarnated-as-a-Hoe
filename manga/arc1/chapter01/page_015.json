  "prompt": "Another memory fragment—golden fields at harvest time, neighbors working together, the simple joy of bringing in crops. Howen's human life, complete and whole. A woman's face laughing (her own, seen in a friend's reaction), hands passing bread, the community that made the hard work worthwhile. Edges softer now, nostalgic rather than painful. Warm golden harvest light, community gathered, joy visible in postures and gestures, dreamy soft-focus edges. Style: Pastoral memory, harvest celebration, bittersweet nostalgia. Mood: Longing, love for what was lost, identity anchor.",
