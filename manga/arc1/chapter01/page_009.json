  "prompt": "The blue glow flickers wildly with emotional distress, the light source itself seeming to scream. From the wooden handle, small green roots begin to sprout—Howen's first unconscious use of her plant-growth power, triggered by trauma. The roots reach blindly, desperately, seeking something solid to anchor to. The surrounding darkness seems to pulse with her anguish. Wild blue light alternating with new green plant glow creates chaotic shadows as roots emerge. Style: Power awakening, emotional overflow visualization. Mood: Anguish, rage, loss of control.",
