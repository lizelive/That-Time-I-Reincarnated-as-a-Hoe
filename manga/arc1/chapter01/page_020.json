  "prompt": "More mushrooms sprout in rapid succession, each one adding its purple light to the growing illumination. A cluster, then another, spreading outward from Howen's position. The vault begins to reveal itself—dusty floor, ancient metal walls, the shapes of caskets emerging from shadow. Light conquers darkness, one fungus at a time. Multiple bioluminescent mushrooms spreading, purple light growing, vault features emerging, shadows retreating. Style: Growth acceleration, revelation through light. Mood: Accomplishment, wonder, the world taking shape.",
