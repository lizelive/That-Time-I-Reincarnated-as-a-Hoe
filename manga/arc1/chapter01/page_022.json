  "prompt": "Close-up of Howen's form fully revealed in the mushroom light—a beautifully crafted farming hoe lying on a dusty shelf. The wooden handle shows centuries of age but remains solid. Plasteel reinforcement bands gleam. The curved blade bears intricate archotech circuitry that pulses with steady blue light—her consciousness made visible. She is beautiful in a way, despite being a tool. Detailed close-up of Howen as hoe, archotech circuitry glowing blue, aged wood grain visible, plasteel reflecting purple light, dust around, shelf beneath. Style: Character portrait, identity reveal. Mood: Acceptance, strange beauty, this is what I am.",
