  "prompt": "A memory flash tears through the darkness—a woman's hands working rich brown soil in golden sunlight, the hands weathered and strong with dirt beneath the fingernails. Green crop rows stretch toward a distant farmhouse under a clear blue sky. Pre-collapse Earth in all its pastoral beauty. The image has soft, dreamlike edges, fragments missing like a photograph torn and reassembled. Warm golden sunlight pours across the scene, but the edges blur into darkness, indicating this is memory, not reality. Style: Memory visualization, pastoral nostalgia with dream decay. Mood: Nostalgic, yearning, a life lost.",
  "caption": "I remember... hands. My hands. Dirt beneath fingernails. The smell of growing things.",
  "narration": "Fragments surfaced—a life that felt like mine but couldn't be. Not anymore.",
