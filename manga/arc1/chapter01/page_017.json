  "prompt": "Howen reaches out psychically, her senses extending into the dust around her, searching for life. She finds something—fungal spores, dormant but alive, scattered through the ancient dust. The visualization shows tiny particles glowing faintly in response to her attention, potential waiting to be activated. The discovery sparks hope. Blue light reaching out, tiny particles in the dust responding with faint glow, the connection between tool and life forming. Style: Psychic connection visualization, life detection. Mood: Discovery, hope, the first step.",
