  "prompt": "Point of view looking down the length of a wooden handle reinforced with bands of gleaming plasteel—Howen's first realization of her current form. The aged oak handle stretches away into darkness, its surface showing the patina of centuries, grain visible in the blue light. Metal reinforcement bands catch and reflect the glow. The handle curves slightly at the far end, disappearing into shadow. The perspective is intimate, strange—looking along oneself. Blue light from the POV illuminates the handle's texture and the plasteel's reflective surface. Style: First-person body horror, tool perspective. Mood: Discovery, dawning realization, wrongness.",
