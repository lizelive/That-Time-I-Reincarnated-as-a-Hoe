  "prompt": "The roots slowly recede back into the wood as Howen forces calm through sheer will. The blue glow stabilizes to a steady, determined pulse. The crisis passes, acceptance beginning to take hold. The surrounding dust settles. A sense of stillness returns, but different now—not the stillness of void, but of decision. Steady blue light returns, the roots withdrawing, dust particles settling slowly through the illumination. Style: Emotional recovery, willpower triumph. Mood: Resolve, acceptance, moving forward.",
  "caption": "...It doesn't matter. Not right now. What matters is: where am I, and how do I get out?",
  "narration": "I couldn't change what had been done. I could only decide what comes next. And I chose: survive.",
