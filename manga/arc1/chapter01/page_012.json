  "prompt": "A much larger shape looms in the deeper darkness beyond the caskets—massive, multi-segmented, mechanical. The dormant Centipede mechanoid, powered down but still terrifying. Howen's light barely reaches it, revealing only hints: segmented armor, folded legs, the cold gleam of weapons. Every instinct screams danger. Distant blue light catches just enough of the massive mechanoid to suggest its horrifying scale and purpose. Red sensor lights remain dark—for now. Style: Monster reveal, dormant threat. Mood: Dread, primal fear, something worse waiting.",
