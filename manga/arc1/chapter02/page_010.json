Its body relaxes slightly, mandibles unclenching. First communication attempt. Blue light pulses in deliberate rhythm, the nymph's body language shifting from fear to curiosity as it responds to the pattern. Style: Communication attempt, light language. Mood: Hope, reaching out, connection forming.",
