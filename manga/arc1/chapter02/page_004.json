  "prompt": "Howen's POV looking across her mushroom garden toward the darkness where the Centipede sleeps. The garden creates a pocket of light and life, while beyond its edge, the mechanoid's silhouette remains still and dormant. The contrast between living light and dead metal is stark. Warm purple garden glow gives way to cold darkness where the Centipede waits, its form barely visible. Style: Safe haven visualization, danger beyond. Mood: Vigilance, territorial awareness, uneasy peace.",

  "narration": "I kept watch. The metal monster never stirred, but I never stopped watching. Some fears are too important to forget.",
