  "prompt": "A close view of mushroom caps of various sizes growing from cracks in ancient metal, their bioluminescent surfaces showing delicate gill patterns beneath. Spores drift upward like tiny stars, catching the purple light. The perspective is from ground level, looking up at the underside of the larger caps. Soft purple light emanates from the caps themselves, creating an ethereal glow that illuminates the spore drift. Style: Macro nature photography, alien biology. Mood: Wonder, creation, delicate beauty.",
  "caption": "I learned their names\u2014or gave them names. The Glowcaps for light. The Sporedrifts for spreading. The Boompuffs... those required careful handling.",
  "narration": "A farmer knows her crops. These were strange crops, but they were MINE. I cultivated them, guided them, shaped their growth with my will.",
