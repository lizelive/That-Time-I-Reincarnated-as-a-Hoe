  "prompt": "The nymph reaches the nearest mushroom and, after a moment's hesitation, takes a careful bite. Its compound eyes never leave Howen's glow as it eats, watching for threat or permission. Howen's light remains steady, calm, accepting. The feeding is now a shared moment, not theft. Soft purple glow from the mushroom being eaten illuminates the nymph's mandibles at work, blue light steady above. Style: Shared moment, feeding permission. Mood: Trust established, acceptance, first friendship.",
