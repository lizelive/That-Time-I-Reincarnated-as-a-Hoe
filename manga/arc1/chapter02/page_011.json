  "prompt": "The nymph takes a cautious step closer, then another, drawn by the gentle pulse of Howen's light. Its pale carapace shows a distinctive crack pattern running across one shoulder plate\u2014like a lightning bolt. This one is marked, distinctive. The individual now has an identifier. Purple mushroom light creates a path of illumination for the approaching nymph, its lightning-bolt marking clearly visible. Style: Approach sequence, distinctive marking. Mood: Trust building, identity forming.",
