  "prompt": "A single pale megascarab nymph emerges hesitantly at the very edge of the mushroom light, its cat-sized body low to the ground, antennae waving. The nymph is pale white with iridescent patches beginning to form on its developing carapace. Its mandibles are folded non-threateningly, and its large compound eyes reflect the purple glow. Single purple mushroom creates spotlight effect on the emerging nymph, its pale carapace contrasting with the shadows behind. Style: First contact moment, animal behavior. Mood: Tentative, curiosity, brave emergence.",
