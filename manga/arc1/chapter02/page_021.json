Chitin immediately moves to position itself between the sound and Howen, tiny mandibles raised in threat despite its small size. Protection instinct, even from something so young. Chitin in protective stance, body tense, facing the darkness while purple light from the garden illuminates its brave silhouette. Style: Guardian stance, protective behavior. Mood: Alert, protective, brave despite size.",
